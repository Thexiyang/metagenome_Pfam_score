Following the method of Wardlaw and Valentine, pore water was extracted from one-half of the sediment by centrifugation (12,000 x g, 15 min) and filtered through a 0.2-µm filter. The remaining sediment was stored at -80°C for subsequent molecular analyses. Sediment from a second core was extruded at 1-cm intervals, placed in acid-washed (20% HCl), precombusted (450°C, 4 h) glass vials, and stored at -20°C prior to analysis of bulk sediment chemical properties.","feature":"extreme habitat ; hypersaline","biome":"extreme habitat ; hypersaline","latitude":"33.4167","collection_date":"2006-08-23","collection_timezone":"UTC","material":"extreme habitat ; hypersaline","temperature":"30-34","longitude":"-115.9167","depth":"14","continent":"north_america","location":"Salton Sea, California"}}},"pipeline_version":"3.0","mixs_compliant":0,"url":"http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/metagenome/mgm4440327.3?verbosity=metadata","version":1,"library":["mgl51618","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl51618"]}
