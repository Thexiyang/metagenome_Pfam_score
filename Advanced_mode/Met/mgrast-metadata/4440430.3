The study environments included a freshwater aquaculture system and three solar saltern environments of differing salinity. Populations within the communities were monitored at both the coarse-grained level of species and the fine-grained level of strains. On the basis of our results, we propose a model for these stable aquatic environments that is consistent with a Kill-the-Winner cycling of predator and prey populations and in which sensitive microbial strains are killed off by viral predators and are replaced by phage-resistant strains of the same species.","project_funding":"NSF, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, ARCS Fellowship, NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship #DBI-0511948, ATP/Kent Sea Tech and EMBO ASTF366-2007 short-term fellowship.","PI_firstname":"Beltran","PI_lastname":"Rodriguez-Brito"},"id":"mgp11","name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study"},"library":{"data":{"misc_param":"sequences_sequences_filtered: Removed redundant contigs","gold_id":"Gm00134","file_name":"HighSalternSDbayMicA200407.fna","metagenome_id":"4440430.3","metagenome_name":"HighSalternSDbayMicA200407","pubmed_id":"18337718, 20147985","seq_center":"454 Life Sciences, Inc, Branford, CT","sample_name":"HighSalternSDbayMicA200407","file_checksum":"0a3cd15150c6fce2ff3972200a161409","seq_meth":"454","investigation_type":"metagenome"},"id":"mgl69169","name":"HighSalternSDbayMicA200407","type":"WGS"},"env_package":{"data":{"salinity":"27-30%","env_package":"water","sample_name":"HighSalternSDbayMicA200407"},"id":"mge69168","type":"water","name":"HighSalternSDbayMicA200407: water"},"sample":{"data":{"sample_name":"HighSalternSDbayMicA200407","samp_collect_device":"Water samples from the solar saltern of South Bay Salt Works (Chula Vista, CA, USA) were collected from three ponds with different salinities: low (6-8%), medium (12-14%), and high (27-30%). Salinity was measured with a hand refractometer. The time between samplings ranged from 1 day to ~1.33 years (Table 1). Viral and microbial fractions were isolated from each water sample by passage through a 0.2-&#956;m tangential flow filter (TFF, Millipore, Westborough, MA, USA). The filtrate and the retentate were collected in separate tanks. The virus-containing filtrate was concentrated to a final volume of ~500&#8201;ml using a 100-kDa TFF filter. Polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) was added to a final concentration of 10% (w/v) and the mixture was incubated for 12-18&#8201;h at 4&#8201;ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ°C.
