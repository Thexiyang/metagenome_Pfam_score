To investigate the composition of organisms in this space, we applied culture-independent approaches to microbes harvested from the air of two densely populated urban buildings, from which we analyzed 80 megabases genomic DNA sequence and 6000 16S rDNA clones. The air microbiota is primarily bacteria, including potential opportunistic pathogens commonly isolated from human-inhabited environments such as hospitals, but none of the data contain matches to virulent pathogens or bioterror agents. Comparison of air samples with each other and nearby environments suggested that the indoor air microbes are not random transients from surrounding outdoor environments, but rather originate from indoor niches. Sequence annotation by gene function revealed specific adaptive capabilities enriched in the air environment, including genes potentially involved in resistance to desiccation and oxidative damage. This baseline index of air microbiota will be valuable for improving designs of surveillance for natural or man-made release of virulent pathogens."},"id":"mgp121","name":"The Airborne Metagenome in an Indoor Urban Environment (Singapore)"},"sample":{"data":{"elevation":"0 ; Meter","country":"Singapore","temperature":"25 ; Celsius","isol_growth_condt":"18382653","location":"Indoor Shopping Center","latitude":"1.30726","samp_collect_device":"We collected indoor air filters installed in two shopping centers at locations 1 and 2 in Singapore (Figure 1A), between March and April of 2005, for isolation of airborne microbes.\r\n\r\nThree pieces of air filters from each site (6 million cubic meters of air per location) were soaked and washed with 10 liters of PBS buffer. The PBS contained no detectable bacterial contamination as determined by PCR using bacterial 16S specific primers (data not shown). The suspension was then filtered through WhatmanÃÂ® filter paper (#114) to remove big particles. We also tested Whatman 3MM Chr filter paper (Cat#3030917) for removing the dusts. Although the flow through was much clearer, the microbial yield was quite low. In both cases, the filtrates were then concentrated by 0.2 ÃÂµm tangential flow filters (Amersham, CFP-2-E-4A). The microbes were pelleted by centrifugation (9,500 g) at 4ÃÂ°C for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of PBS and stored at &#8722;80ÃÂ°C.\r\n\r\nMicrobial genomic DNA was extracted using the PUREGENEÃÂ® DNA PURIFICATION KIT (Cat No. D-6000A, Gentra Systems, USA), following the manufacturer's protocol.","depth":"0 ; Meter","feature":"air","collection_time":"13:00:00","collection_timezone":"UTC","continent":"asia","samp_size":"6 million cubic meters of air","longitude":"103.903885","altitude":"0 ; Meter","collection_date":"2005-03-31","biome":"air","material":"air","env_package":"air"},"name":"mgs25790","id":"mgs25790"}},"project":["mgp121","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/project/mgp121"],"pipeline_version":"3.0","job_id":"25543","sample":["mgs25790","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs25790"],"md5_checksum":"e6e5f4eefce39fa0a8e468db4093672d","created":"2011-06-08 20:13:09","id":"mgm4465946.3","url":"http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/metagenome/mgm4465946.3?verbosity=metadata","sequence_type":"Unknown","version":1}
