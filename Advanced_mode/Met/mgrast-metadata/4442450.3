Previous investigations characterizing bacterioplankton diversity demonstrated that the variable estuarine environment selects for a unique bacterioplankton assemblage whose composition is temporally and spatially dynamic. The earliest demonstrations that virioplankton exhibit seasonally dynamic patterns of abundance, diversity, and composition  were obtained from studies of the Chesapeake Bay. This report describes an analysis of the first estuarine viral community metagenome from the Chesapeake Bay in terms of the viral community's taxonomic, functional, and genotypic diversity.","firstname":" - ","PI_organization_country":"USA","PI_firstname":"K.

At station 858 a bottom water sample from 2 m above the sediment-water interface was also obtained using Niskin bottles on a conductivity-temperature-depth rosette. Water was passed through a 25-&#956;m wound cartridge filter, and viruses were concentrated using a two-step tangential flow filtration process, resulting in an approximately 250-ml viral concentrate sample. In the first tangential flow filtration step a 0.22-&#956;m-pore-size, 0.5-m2  Pellicon cartridge filter (Millipore Corp.) was used to remove all cells. Viruses in the 0.22-&#956;m filtrate were concentrated to a final volume of 2 liters using 10-m2 30,000-molecular-weight cutoff spiral filters (Helicon; Millipore Corp.). In the final step a smaller (0.5-m2) 30,000-molecular-weight cutoff spiral filter (Pellicon; Millipore Corp.) was used to concentrate viruses in a final volume of 250 ml. On shore, 200 ml of each viral concentrate was further concentrated using 30,000-molecular-weight cutoff Centricon Plus-80 spin filters (Millipore Corp.) to a final volume of approximately 2 ml.","geodetic_system":"wgs_84","isol_growth_condt":"17921274","material":"marine habitat","location":"Chesapeake Bay","samp_size":"50 Liter","samp_mat_process":"concentration","feature":"marine habitat","longitude":"-76.433","collection_timezone":"UTC","latitude":"38.5667","continent":"north_america","depth":"surface","country":"United States of America"},"name":"mgs22432","id":"mgs22432"},"library":{"data":{"metagenome_name":"Chesapeake Bay Virioplankton - Station 834","gold_id":"Gm00053","lib_size":"550-650","metagenome_id":"4442450.3","sequences_sequences_combined_libraries":"Sequences are from combined libraries","lib_type":"small insert shotgun","file_checksum":"57aeeb84c02e34ae62c1c93d96076e0b","pubmed_id":"17921274, 10704475 , 9872784, 9872785","sequences_sequences_filtered":"Sequences were screened for vector sequence, linker sequence, and minimum base quality using Phred and Crossmatch (28).
