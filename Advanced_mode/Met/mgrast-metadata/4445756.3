Here we use a metagenomic approach to identify metabolic and taxonomic shifts in microbial communities associated with the hard coral Acropora millepora throughout a natural thermal bleaching event at Magnetic Island (Great Barrier Reef). A direct comparison of metagenomic data sets from healthy versus bleached corals indicated major shifts in microbial associates during heat stress, including Bacteria, Archaea, viruses, Fungi and micro-algae. Overall, metabolism of the microbial community shifted from autotrophy to heterotrophy, including increases in genes associated with the metabolism of fatty acids, proteins, simple carbohydrates, phosphorus and sulfur. In addition, the proportion of virulence genes was higher in the bleached library, indicating an increase in microorganisms capable of pathogenesis following bleaching. These results demonstrate that thermal stress results in shifts in coral-associated microbial communities that may lead to deteriorating coral health.","organization_address":"Cape Fergusson ; 3340 ; Townsville ; QLD","administrative-contact_PI_organization_url":"www.aims.gov.au"},"name":"Project for: October coral","public":"Project for: October coral"},"env_package":{"id":"mge51827","data":{"env_package":"host-associated","host_common_name":"branching coral","host_taxid":"Acropora millepora","life_stage":"adult","sex":"Hermaphrodite"},"type":"host-associated","name":"mge51827"}},"id":"mgm4445756.3","name":"October coral","pipeline_version":"3.0","sample":["mgs18056","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs18056"],"status":"public","mixs_compliant":1}
