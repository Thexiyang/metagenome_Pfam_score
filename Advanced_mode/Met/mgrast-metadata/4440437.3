The study environments included a freshwater aquaculture system and three solar saltern environments of differing salinity. Populations within the communities were monitored at both the coarse-grained level of species and the fine-grained level of strains. On the basis of our results, we propose a model for these stable aquatic environments that is consistent with a Kill-the-Winner cycling of predator and prey populations and in which sensitive microbial strains are killed off by viral predators and are replaced by phage-resistant strains of the same species.","lastname":" - ","email":" - ","PI_organization":"Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University","PI_firstname":"Beltran","firstname":" - ","organization_address":" - ","PI_email":"beltran.rodriguezbrito@gmail.com","project_funding":"NSF, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, ARCS Fellowship, NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship #DBI-0511948, ATP/Kent Sea Tech and EMBO ASTF366-2007 short-term fellowship.","PI_organization_address":"San Diego, CA","organization":" - ","project_name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","PI_organization_url":"www.csrc.sdsu.edu/","PI_organization_country":"USA","ncbi_id":"28353, 28725","organization_country":" - "},"public":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","id":"mgp11"},"sample":{"data":{"longitude":"-117.1072","country":"United States of America","biome":"marine biome","isol_growth_condt":"20147985","collection_date":"2004-07-01","continent":"north america","samp_collect_device":"Water samples from the solar saltern of South Bay Salt Works (Chula Vista, CA, USA) were collected from three ponds with different salinities: low (6-8%), medium (12-14%), and high (27-30%).
