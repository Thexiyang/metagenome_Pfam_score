On the basis of a comparative metagenomic analysis of viral communities associated with marine (Highborne Cay, Bahamas) and freshwater (Pozas Azules II and Rio Mesquites, Mexico) microbialites, we show that some phage genotypes are geographically restricted.","PI_lastname":"Breitbart","organization":" - ","lastname":" - ","organization_country":" - ","organization_url":" - ","PI_organization_country":"USA"}},"sample":{"id":"mgs17237","name":"mgs17237","data":{"isol_growth_condt":"18311127","samp_mat_process":"filtering","material":"marine habitat","feature":"marine habitat","samp_collect_device":"Microbialites were collected in November 2005 from the Highborne Cay Island in the Bahamas.
