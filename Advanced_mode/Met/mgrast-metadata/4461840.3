The latter two soils were used as reference to assess the changes in microbial community under HCH stress at the dumpsite. Soil subsamples (10 subsamples from each location) were collected at a depth of 20 cm and pooled together. Composite soil sample from each location (air dried) was thoroughly ground, homogenized by sieving through fine mesh. The extraction of HCH residues from the samples was carried out as described earlier (Jit et al., 2010).
