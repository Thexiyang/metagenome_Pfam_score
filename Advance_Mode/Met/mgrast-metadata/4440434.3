The study environments included a freshwater aquaculture system and three solar saltern environments of differing salinity. Populations within the communities were monitored at both the coarse-grained level of species and the fine-grained level of strains. On the basis of our results, we propose a model for these stable aquatic environments that is consistent with a Kill-the-Winner cycling of predator and prey populations and in which sensitive microbial strains are killed off by viral predators and are replaced by phage-resistant strains of the same species.","organization_country":" - ","organization_url":" - ","PI_organization":"Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University","project_funding":"NSF, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, ARCS Fellowship, NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship #DBI-0511948, ATP/Kent Sea Tech and EMBO ASTF366-2007 short-term fellowship.","email":" - ","lastname":" - ","PI_organization_address":"San Diego, CA","PI_organization_url":"www.csrc.sdsu.edu/","project_name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","PI_organization_country":"USA","PI_email":"beltran.rodriguezbrito@gmail.com","organization":" - ","ncbi_id":"28353, 28725","firstname":" - "},"public":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","id":"mgp11"},"env_package":{"id":"mge69216","name":"MedSalternSDbayMic20051111: water","data":{"biomass":"5.89E7 cells/ml","env_package":"water","sample_name":"MedSalternSDbayMic20051111","salinity":"12-14%"},"type":"water"},"sample":{"id":"mgs69215","data":{"misc_param":"geodetic_system: wgs_84","continent":"north america","biome":"marine biome","env_package":"water","samp_collect_device":"Water samples from the solar saltern of South Bay Salt Works (Chula Vista, CA, USA) were collected from three ponds with different salinities: low (6-8%), medium (12-14%), and high (27-30%).
