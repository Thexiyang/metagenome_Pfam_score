The study environments included a freshwater aquaculture system and three solar saltern environments of differing salinity. Populations within the communities were monitored at both the coarse-grained level of species and the fine-grained level of strains. On the basis of our results, we propose a model for these stable aquatic environments that is consistent with a Kill-the-Winner cycling of predator and prey populations and in which sensitive microbial strains are killed off by viral predators and are replaced by phage-resistant strains of the same species.","project_name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","PI_organization_url":"www.csrc.sdsu.edu/","organization_url":" - ","firstname":" - ","PI_lastname":"Rodriguez-Brito","PI_organization_country":"USA","PI_organization":"Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University","organization":" - ","organization_country":" - ","PI_organization_address":"San Diego, CA"},"name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study"},"library":{"id":"mgl69202","data":{"metagenome_name":"LowSalternSDbayVir200407","seq_center":"454 Life Sciences, Inc, Branford, CT","investigation_type":"metagenome","lib_size_mean":"103.5","pubmed_id":"18337718, 20147985","gold_id":"Gm00134","file_name":"LowSalternSDbayVir200407.fna","seq_meth":"454","sample_name":"LowSalternSDbayVir200407","file_checksum":"44f448599e4a4dcc698d771cbcad2d7d","misc_param":"sequences_sequences_filtered: Removed redundant contigs","metagenome_id":"4440436.3"},"type":"WGS","name":"LowSalternSDbayVir200407"},"sample":{"data":{"collection_time":"00:00:00","longitude":"-117.1072","sample_name":"LowSalternSDbayVir200407","isol_growth_condt":"20147985","collection_date":"2004-07-01","samp_collect_device":"Water samples from the solar saltern of South Bay Salt Works (Chula Vista, CA, USA) were collected from three ponds with different salinities: low (6-8%), medium (12-14%), and high (27-30%).

Viral and microbial fractions were isolated from each water sample by passage through a 0.2-&#956;m tangential flow filter (TFF, Millipore, Westborough, MA, USA). The filtrate and the retentate were collected in separate tanks. The virus-containing filtrate was concentrated to a final volume of ~500&#8201;ml using a 100-kDa TFF filter.
