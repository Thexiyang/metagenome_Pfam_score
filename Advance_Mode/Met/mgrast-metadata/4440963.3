The dense, tofu-like texture of this mat allows intact cross-sections to be obtained down to approx 1 mm thickness. The mat, dominated by bacteria, was reported to be one of the world's richest and most diverse microbial communities, comprising at least 752 observed species from 42 bacterial phyla, including 15 novel candidate phyla (Ley et al, 2006). As the mat grows in hypersaline waters (approx3 times the salinity of sea water), we were also interested to look for evidence of molecular adaptations to hypersalinity in the mat community.\r\n\r\nTo investigate the extent of genetic stratification in structured microbial communities, we compared the metagenomes of 10 successive layers of a phylogenetically complex hypersaline mat from Guerrero Negro, Mexico. We found pronounced millimeter-scale genetic gradients that were consistent with the physicochemical profile of the mat. Despite these gradients, all layers displayed near-identical and acid-shifted isoelectric point profiles due to a molecular convergence of amino-acid usage, indicating that hypersalinity enforces an overriding selective pressure on the mat community.","project_funding":"US Department of Energy","organization_url":" - ","project_name":"Guerrero Negro Metagenomes","PI_organization_address":"Walnut Creek, CA","PI_organization_url":"www.jgi.doe.gov","PI_organization":"Microbial Ecology Program, DOE Joint Genome Institute"},"name":"Guerrero Negro Metagenomes"},"library":{"id":"mgl52748","name":"mgl52748","type":"WGS","data":{"library_notes":"DNA was end- sequenced using capillary sequencing.","host_cells":"pUC18","metagenome_id":"4440963.3","sequences_sequences_assembled":"Assembled contigs","file_checksum":"b5de17d146c839d3835517ce28a2186a","metagenome_name":"Guerrero Negro 1-2mm","seq_meth":"other","investigation_type":"mimarks-survey","pubmed_id":"18523433","sequences_sequences_predicted_genes":"Metagenome data cosists of predicted genes","gold_id":"Gm00009","sequences_sequences_filtered":"Removed redundant contigs"}},"sample":{"id":"mgs25332","data":{"biome":"microbial mat","elevation":"310","longitude":"-113.9170","material":"microbial mat","samp_collect_device":"The 25 x 25 cm x 6 cm mat piece was brought to shore in a pan of its own water.
