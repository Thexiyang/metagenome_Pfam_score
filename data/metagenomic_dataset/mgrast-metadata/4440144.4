Viral and microbial fractions were isolated from each water sample by passage through a 0.2-&#956;m tangential flow filter (TFF, Millipore, Westborough, MA, USA). The filtrate and the retentate were collected in separate tanks. The virus-containing filtrate was concentrated to a final volume of ~500&#8201;ml using a 100-kDa TFF filter. Polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) was added to a final concentration of 10% (w/v) and the mixture was incubated for 12-18&#8201;h at 4&#8201;ÃÂÃÂ°C.

The study environments included a freshwater aquaculture system and three solar saltern environments of differing salinity. Populations within the communities were monitored at both the coarse-grained level of species and the fine-grained level of strains. On the basis of our results, we propose a model for these stable aquatic environments that is consistent with a Kill-the-Winner cycling of predator and prey populations and in which sensitive microbial strains are killed off by viral predators and are replaced by phage-resistant strains of the same species.","organization_url":" - ","organization_country":" - ","PI_organization_url":"www.csrc.sdsu.edu/","organization":" - ","PI_lastname":"Rodriguez-Brito","PI_organization":"Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University","lastname":" - ","project_name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","project_funding":"NSF, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, ARCS Fellowship, NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship #DBI-0511948, ATP/Kent Sea Tech and EMBO ASTF366-2007 short-term fellowship.","email":" - ","PI_organization_address":"San Diego, CA"},"id":"mgp11","name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","public":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study"}},"version":1,"library":["mgl69184","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl69184"],"pipeline_parameters":{"rna_pid":"97","filter_ambig":"yes","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens","prefix_length":"50","file_type":"fna","m5nr_sims_version":"7","priority":"never","aa_pid":"90","max_ambig":"5","bowtie":"yes","m5rna_sims_version":"7","m5nr_annotation_version":"1","m5rna_annotation_version":"1","filter_ln":"yes","assembled":"no","dereplicate":"yes","fgs_type":"454","filter_ln_mult":"2.0"},"job_id":"315"}
