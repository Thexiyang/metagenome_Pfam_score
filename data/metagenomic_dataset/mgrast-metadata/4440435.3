Viral and microbial fractions were isolated from each water sample by passage through a 0.2-&#956;m tangential flow filter (TFF, Millipore, Westborough, MA, USA). The filtrate and the retentate were collected in separate tanks.","sample_name":"MedSalternSDbayMic20051110","location":"Chula Vista, CA","continent":"north america","latitude":"32.6","isol_growth_condt":"20147985","collection_timezone":"UTC","country":"United States of America","misc_param":"geodetic_system: wgs_84","material":"saline water","feature":"saline evaporation pond","collection_time":"00:00:00","collection_date":"2005-11-10"},"id":"mgs69212"},"project":{"id":"mgp11","data":{"PI_email":"beltran.rodriguezbrito@gmail.com","PI_organization":"Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University","PI_organization_country":"USA","organization_address":" - ","PI_organization_address":"San Diego, CA","PI_organization_url":"www.csrc.sdsu.edu/","project_description":"Water samples from the solar saltern of South Bay Salt Works (Chula Vista, CA, USA) were collected from three ponds with different salinities: low (68%), medium (1214%), and high (2730%). \r\nIn this study, we used metagenomics to monitor the viral and microbial communities in this and 3 other distinctive, stable, human-controlled aquatic environments over time. The study environments included a freshwater aquaculture system and three solar saltern environments of differing salinity. Populations within the communities were monitored at both the coarse-grained level of species and the fine-grained level of strains. On the basis of our results, we propose a model for these stable aquatic environments that is consistent with a Kill-the-Winner cycling of predator and prey populations and in which sensitive microbial strains are killed off by viral predators and are replaced by phage-resistant strains of the same species.","PI_firstname":"Beltran","firstname":" - ","project_name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","ncbi_id":"28353, 28725","project_funding":"NSF, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, ARCS Fellowship, NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship #DBI-0511948, ATP/Kent Sea Tech and EMBO ASTF366-2007 short-term fellowship.","organization":" - ","organization_country":" - ","organization_url":" - ","email":" - ","lastname":" - ","PI_lastname":"Rodriguez-Brito"},"name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","public":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study"}},"library":["mgl69214","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl69214"],"version":1,"name":"MedSalternSDbayMic20051110","sequence_type":"WGS","status":"public","sample":["mgs69212","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs69212"],"url":"http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/metagenome/mgm4440435.3?verbosity=metadata","job_id":"331","mixs_compliant":1,"pipeline_version":"3.0","id":"mgm4440435.3","created":"2007-12-23 21:10:31","md5_checksum":"d3ddeab9276f4e4c6451532bffc2bd69","pipeline_parameters":{"filter_ambig":"yes","m5rna_sims_version":"7","bowtie":"yes","assembled":"no","m5nr_annotation_version":"1","m5nr_sims_version":"7","aa_pid":"90","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens","rna_pid":"97","max_ambig":"5","prefix_length":"50","priority":"never","fgs_type":"454","filter_ln":"yes","dereplicate":"yes","filter_ln_mult":"2.0","file_type":"fna","m5rna_annotation_version":"1"}}
