Viral concentrates were imaged by transmission electron microscopy (Leo 912AB operating at 80 kV). Direct viral enumeration was performed by epifluorescence microscopy (51). Following the recommendations of Wen et al. (84), samples were unfixed and were stained with Sybr gold. The samples were stored at 4°C for no more than 24 h before being counted. Immediate freezing of samples in liquid nitrogen was not possible, so viral abundances may be somewhat underestimated.","continent":"north_america","material":"hot spring","longitude":"-110.797944","geodetic_system":"wgs_84","biome":"hot spring","altitude":"~2438"}},"library":{"data":{"metagenome_name":"Terrestrial Hot Springs - Octopus","metagenome_id":"4441096.3","forward_primers":"5&#8242;-AGCAGTATCAGATACAAGCGGCCGCATC-3&#8242;","cloning_kit":"pSMART vector (Lucigen)","pcr_clean_up_methods":"Gel fractionation","gold_id":"Gm00077","investigation_type":"mimarks-survey","seq_center":"Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute","pubmed_id":"18441115, 18798991","sequences_sequences_assembled":"Assembled contigs","file_checksum":"ef3901fb615c8ab7be7baa47b22e72a7","seq_meth":"other","pcr_notes":"Viral DNA was physically sheared to 3 to 6 kb using a HydroShear device (Genomic Solutions, Michigan).

However, study of viral metagenomes has been hampered by its nearly complete reliance on BLAST algorithms for identification of DNA sequences. We sought to develop algorithms for examination of viral metagenomes to identify the origin of sequences independent of BLAST algorithms. We chose viral metagenomes obtained from two hot springs, Bear Paw and Octopus, in Yellowstone National Park, as they represent simple microbial populations where comparatively large contigs were obtained. Thermal spring metagenomes have high proportions of sequences without significant Genbank homology, which has hampered identification of viruses and their linkage with hosts. To analyze each metagenome, we developed a method to classify DNA fragments using genome signature-based phylogenetic classification (GSPC), where metagenomic fragments are compared to a database of oligonucleotide signatures for all previously sequenced Bacteria, Archaea, and viruses.","email":" - ","PI_lastname":"Schoenfeld","PI_firstname":"Thomas","organization_url":" - ","ncbi_id":"20821","PI_organization":"Department of Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine","PI_organization_country":"USA","firstname":" - ","organization_country":" - ","project_name":"Viral Metagenome from Terrestrial Hot Springs","lastname":" - ","project_funding":"NSF, Burroughs Wellcome Fund, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the UNCF-Merck Science Initiative to DP","organization":" - ","organization_address":" - "}}},"sequence_type":"WGS","created":"2008-06-30 19:05:46","name":"Terrestrial Hot Springs - Octopus","library":["mgl52280","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl52280"],"version":1}
