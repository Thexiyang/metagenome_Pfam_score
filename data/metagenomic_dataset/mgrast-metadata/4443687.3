Despite the fundamental role that the cold biosphere plays in maintaining the health of the planet, relatively little is known about the resident microorganisms and the biogeochemical processes they drive.\r\n\r\nBy linking metagenomic and functional data to climate records, geochemical and physical data, we will be in a unique position to derive an integrated understanding of how the lake and oceanic microorganisms have evolved, transformed, and presently interact with the pristine Antarctic environment.
