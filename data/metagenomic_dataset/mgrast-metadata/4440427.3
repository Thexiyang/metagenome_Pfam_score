Salinity was measured with a hand refractometer. The time between samplings ranged from 1 day to ~1.33 years (Table 1). Viral and microbial fractions were isolated from each water sample by passage through a 0.2-&#956;m tangential flow filter (TFF, Millipore, Westborough, MA, USA). The filtrate and the retentate were collected in separate tanks. The virus-containing filtrate was concentrated to a final volume of ~500&#8201;ml using a 100-kDa TFF filter. Polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) was added to a final concentration of 10% (w/v) and the mixture was incubated for 12-18&#8201;h at 4&#8201;ÃÂÃÂ°C. The VLPs were pelleted by centrifuging for 2&#8201;h at 22&#8201;000&#8201;rpm in an SW41Ti swinging bucket rotor (RCF avg=53&#8201;000 ÃÂÃÂ g). The VLP pellet was resuspended in filtered (100&#8201;kDa) saltern water to a final volume of ~50&#8201;ml.

The study environments included a freshwater aquaculture system and three solar saltern environments of differing salinity. Populations within the communities were monitored at both the coarse-grained level of species and the fine-grained level of strains. On the basis of our results, we propose a model for these stable aquatic environments that is consistent with a Kill-the-Winner cycling of predator and prey populations and in which sensitive microbial strains are killed off by viral predators and are replaced by phage-resistant strains of the same species.","lastname":" - ","organization_url":" - ","PI_lastname":"Rodriguez-Brito","PI_email":"beltran.rodriguezbrito@gmail.com","PI_organization_url":"www.csrc.sdsu.edu/","PI_organization_country":"USA","project_funding":"NSF, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, ARCS Fellowship, NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship #DBI-0511948, ATP/Kent Sea Tech and EMBO ASTF366-2007 short-term fellowship."},"name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","id":"mgp11"}},"library":["mgl69235","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl69235"],"pipeline_parameters":{"filter_ln_mult":"2.0","dereplicate":"yes","priority":"never","filter_ln":"yes","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens","max_ambig":"5","file_type":"fna","m5nr_sims_version":"7","assembled":"no","m5rna_annotation_version":"1","bowtie":"yes","aa_pid":"90","rna_pid":"97","m5rna_sims_version":"7","fgs_type":"454","prefix_length":"50","filter_ambig":"yes","m5nr_annotation_version":"1"},"status":"public","sample":["mgs69233","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs69233"],"created":"2007-12-23 20:44:28","job_id":"324"}
