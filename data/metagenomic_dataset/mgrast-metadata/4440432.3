Salinity was measured with a hand refractometer. The time between samplings ranged from 1 day to ~1.33 years (Table 1). Viral and microbial fractions were isolated from each water sample by passage through a 0.2-&#956;m tangential flow filter (TFF, Millipore, Westborough, MA, USA). The filtrate and the retentate were collected in separate tanks. The virus-containing filtrate was concentrated to a final volume of ~500&#8201;ml using a 100-kDa TFF filter. Polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) was added to a final concentration of 10% (w/v) and the mixture was incubated for 12-18&#8201;h at 4&#8201;ÃÂ°C. The VLPs were pelleted by centrifuging for 2&#8201;h at 22&#8201;000&#8201;rpm in an SW41Ti swinging bucket rotor (RCF avg=53&#8201;000 ÃÂ g). The VLP pellet was resuspended in filtered (100&#8201;kDa) saltern water to a final volume of ~50&#8201;ml. The virus concentrate was loaded onto a cesium chloride density gradient, centrifuged, and the 1.5&#8201;g&#8201;ml&#8722;1 fraction was collected.","longitude":"-117.1072","country":"United States of America"},"id":"mgs69203"},"project":{"public":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","data":{"lastname":" - ","project_funding":"NSF, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, ARCS Fellowship, NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship #DBI-0511948, ATP/Kent Sea Tech and EMBO ASTF366-2007 short-term fellowship.","PI_organization_country":"USA","organization_url":" - ","organization":" - ","PI_firstname":"Beltran","project_name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","PI_lastname":"Rodriguez-Brito","organization_address":" - ","organization_country":" - ","PI_email":"beltran.rodriguezbrito@gmail.com","PI_organization":"Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University","project_description":"Water samples from the solar saltern of South Bay Salt Works (Chula Vista, CA, USA) were collected from three ponds with different salinities: low (68%), medium (1214%), and high (2730%). \r\nIn this study, we used metagenomics to monitor the viral and microbial communities in this and 3 other distinctive, stable, human-controlled aquatic environments over time. The study environments included a freshwater aquaculture system and three solar saltern environments of differing salinity. Populations within the communities were monitored at both the coarse-grained level of species and the fine-grained level of strains. On the basis of our results, we propose a model for these stable aquatic environments that is consistent with a Kill-the-Winner cycling of predator and prey populations and in which sensitive microbial strains are killed off by viral predators and are replaced by phage-resistant strains of the same species.","ncbi_id":"28353, 28725","firstname":" - ","email":" - ","PI_organization_address":"San Diego, CA","PI_organization_url":"www.csrc.sdsu.edu/"},"name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","id":"mgp11"},"env_package":{"data":{"env_package":"water","salinity":"6-8%","sample_name":"LowSalternSDbayVir20051110"},"name":"LowSalternSDbayVir20051110: water","type":"water","id":"mge69204"}},"name":"LowSalternSDbayVir20051110","url":"http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/metagenome/mgm4440432.3?verbosity=metadata","id":"mgm4440432.3","pipeline_version":"3.0","pipeline_parameters":{"m5nr_sims_version":"7","m5nr_annotation_version":"1","dereplicate":"yes","priority":"never","max_ambig":"5","prefix_length":"50","filter_ln":"yes","file_type":"fna","filter_ln_mult":"2.0","assembled":"no","rna_pid":"97","fgs_type":"454","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens","m5rna_sims_version":"7","bowtie":"yes","filter_ambig":"yes","aa_pid":"90","m5rna_annotation_version":"1"},"version":1,"library":["mgl69205","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl69205"],"created":"2007-12-23 21:10:31","sequence_type":"WGS","sample":["mgs69203","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs69203"],"project":["mgp11","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/project/mgp11"],"job_id":"329","md5_checksum":"96a2a5e2686f20090c6b80a181904c27","mixs_compliant":1}
