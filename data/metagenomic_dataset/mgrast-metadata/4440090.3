The study environments included a freshwater aquaculture system and three solar saltern environments of differing salinity. Populations within the communities were monitored at both the coarse-grained level of species and the fine-grained level of strains. On the basis of our results, we propose a model for these stable aquatic environments that is consistent with a Kill-the-Winner cycling of predator and prey populations and in which sensitive microbial strains are killed off by viral predators and are replaced by phage-resistant strains of the same species.","organization":" - ","organization_url":" - ","project_funding":"NSF, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, ARCS Fellowship, NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship #DBI-0511948, ATP/Kent Sea Tech and EMBO ASTF366-2007 short-term fellowship.","lastname":" - ","email":" - ","PI_lastname":"Rodriguez-Brito","PI_organization_address":"San Diego, CA","firstname":" - ","PI_organization_country":"USA","PI_email":"beltran.rodriguezbrito@gmail.com","PI_organization":"Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University","organization_country":" - ","project_name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study"},"name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","public":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","id":"mgp11"},"sample":{"data":{"longitude":"-117.1072","material":"saline water","location":"Chula Vista, CA","latitude":"32.6","continent":"north america","feature":"saline evaporation pond","samp_collect_device":"Water samples from the solar saltern of South Bay Salt Works (Chula Vista, CA, USA) were collected from three ponds with different salinities: low (6-8%), medium (12-14%), and high (27-30%). Salinity was measured with a hand refractometer. The time between samplings ranged from 1 day to ~1.33 years (Table 1). Viral and microbial fractions were isolated from each water sample by passage through a 0.2-&#956;m tangential flow filter (TFF, Millipore, Westborough, MA, USA). The filtrate and the retentate were collected in separate tanks. The virus-containing filtrate was concentrated to a final volume of ~500&#8201;ml using a 100-kDa TFF filter. Polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) was added to a final concentration of 10% (w/v) and the mixture was incubated for 12-18&#8201;h at 4&#8201;ÃÂÃÂ°C. The VLPs were pelleted by centrifuging for 2&#8201;h at 22&#8201;000&#8201;rpm in an SW41Ti swinging bucket rotor (RCF avg=53&#8201;000 ÃÂÃÂ g). The VLP pellet was resuspended in filtered (100&#8201;kDa) saltern water to a final volume of ~50&#8201;ml. The virus concentrate was loaded onto a cesium chloride density gradient, centrifuged, and the 1.5&#8201;g&#8201;ml&#8722;1 fraction was collected.","biome":"marine biome","isol_growth_condt":"20147985","collection_time":"00:00:00","collection_timezone":"UTC","sample_name":"LowSalternPlaSDbay20051122","collection_date":"2005-11-22","country":"United States of America","env_package":"water"},"name":"LowSalternPlaSDbay20051122","id":"mgs69188"},"library":{"type":"WGS","id":"mgl69190","data":{"investigation_type":"metagenome","file_name":"LowSalternPlaSDbay20051122.fna","seq_center":"454 Life Sciences, Inc, Branford, CT","gold_id":"Gm00134","pubmed_id":"18337718, 20147985","misc_param":"sequences_sequences_filtered: Removed redundant contigs","metagenome_id":"4440090.3","metagenome_name":"LowSalternPlaSDbay20051122","file_checksum":"d85f5977818f88aa4a8a1d3e81aea7da","seq_meth":"454","sample_name":"LowSalternPlaSDbay20051122"},"name":"LowSalternPlaSDbay20051122"}},"pipeline_parameters":{"m5rna_annotation_version":"1","m5nr_annotation_version":"1","filter_ambig":"yes","bowtie":"yes","filter_ln_mult":"2.0","file_type":"fna","prefix_length":"50","filter_ln":"yes","assembled":"no","priority":"never","dereplicate":"yes","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens","m5rna_sims_version":"7","rna_pid":"97","aa_pid":"90","m5nr_sims_version":"7","max_ambig":"5","fgs_type":"454"},"project":["mgp11","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/project/mgp11"],"created":"2007-07-14 04:23:02","library":["mgl69190","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl69190"],"sample":["mgs69188","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs69188"],"md5_checksum":"d85f5977818f88aa4a8a1d3e81aea7da"}
