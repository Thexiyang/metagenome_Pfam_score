The study environments included a freshwater aquaculture system and three solar saltern environments of differing salinity. Populations within the communities were monitored at both the coarse-grained level of species and the fine-grained level of strains. On the basis of our results, we propose a model for these stable aquatic environments that is consistent with a Kill-the-Winner cycling of predator and prey populations and in which sensitive microbial strains are killed off by viral predators and are replaced by phage-resistant strains of the same species.","organization_country":" - ","project_funding":"NSF, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, ARCS Fellowship, NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship #DBI-0511948, ATP/Kent Sea Tech and EMBO ASTF366-2007 short-term fellowship.","firstname":" - ","project_name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","PI_organization_country":"USA","email":" - ","PI_organization":"Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University"},"id":"mgp11"},"env_package":{"name":"LowSalternSDbayMic20051128: water","type":"water","data":{"biomass":"8.35E6 cells/ml","salinity":"6-8%","env_package":"water","sample_name":"LowSalternSDbayMic20051128"},"id":"mge69198"},"library":{"name":"LowSalternSDbayMic20051128","data":{"file_name":"LowSalternSDbayMic20051128.fna","gold_id":"Gm00134","investigation_type":"metagenome","seq_meth":"454","sample_name":"LowSalternSDbayMic20051128","pubmed_id":"18337718, 20147985","seq_center":"454 Life Sciences, Inc, Branford, CT","misc_param":"sequences_sequences_filtered: Removed redundant contigs","lib_size_mean":"99.7","metagenome_name":"LowSalternSDbayMic20051128","file_checksum":"e2b8808db6c13db47a38c9b5eb377345","metagenome_id":"4440426.3"},"id":"mgl69199","type":"WGS"}},"library":["mgl69199","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl69199"],"pipeline_version":"3.0","id":"mgm4440426.3","url":"http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/metagenome/mgm4440426.3?verbosity=metadata","name":"LowSalternSDbayMic20051128","mixs_compliant":1,"md5_checksum":"e2b8808db6c13db47a38c9b5eb377345","pipeline_parameters":{"filter_ambig":"yes","fgs_type":"454","rna_pid":"97","filter_ln_mult":"2.0","bowtie":"yes","max_ambig":"5","m5nr_sims_version":"7","aa_pid":"90","prefix_length":"50","assembled":"no","m5rna_sims_version":"7","file_type":"fna","m5nr_annotation_version":"1","dereplicate":"yes","filter_ln":"yes","priority":"never","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens","m5rna_annotation_version":"1"},"version":1}
