Four replicate 6 cm thick x 8 mm diameter cores were excised from the middle of the mat sample using a sterile coring instrument. Each core was sectioned into coins as described in Table S2 using sterile scalpel blades for each layer. The mat is vertically striated and these striations were used to ensure that coins 40\twere obtained from the same layer of each replicate core.

The dense, tofu-like texture of this mat allows intact cross-sections to be obtained down to approx 1 mm thickness. The mat, dominated by bacteria, was reported to be one of the world's richest and most diverse microbial communities, comprising at least 752 observed species from 42 bacterial phyla, including 15 novel candidate phyla (Ley et al, 2006). As the mat grows in hypersaline waters (approx3 times the salinity of sea water), we were also interested to look for evidence of molecular adaptations to hypersalinity in the mat community.\r\n\r\nTo investigate the extent of genetic stratification in structured microbial communities, we compared the metagenomes of 10 successive layers of a phylogenetically complex hypersaline mat from Guerrero Negro, Mexico. We found pronounced millimeter-scale genetic gradients that were consistent with the physicochemical profile of the mat. Despite these gradients, all layers displayed near-identical and acid-shifted isoelectric point profiles due to a molecular convergence of amino-acid usage, indicating that hypersalinity enforces an overriding selective pressure on the mat community.","PI_organization_url":"www.jgi.doe.gov","PI_organization_address":"Walnut Creek, CA","PI_lastname":"Hugenholtz","project_name":"Guerrero Negro Metagenomes","email":" - ","organization_url":" - ","project_funding":"US Department of Energy","PI_firstname":"Philip","PI_organization":"Microbial Ecology Program, DOE Joint Genome Institute","firstname":" - ","ncbi_id":"29795, 29615","lastname":" - ","organization":" - ","PI_organization_country":"USA","PI_email":"phugenholtz@lbl.gov","organization_address":" - ","organization_country":" - "}}},"library":["mgl52722","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl52722"],"pipeline_parameters":{"aa_pid":"90","m5nr_annotation_version":"1","max_ambig":"5","filter_ln":"yes","dereplicate":"yes","rna_pid":"97","fgs_type":"454","file_type":"fna","filter_ln_mult":"2.0","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens","prefix_length":"50","m5rna_sims_version":"7","bowtie":"yes","assembled":"no","m5nr_sims_version":"7","priority":"never","m5rna_annotation_version":"1","filter_ambig":"yes"},"sample":["mgs25221","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs25221"],"version":1,"job_id":"827","status":"public","name":"Guerrero Negro 10-22mm","mixs_compliant":0,"project":["mgp12","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/project/mgp12"],"id":"mgm4440968.3","pipeline_version":"3.0","sequence_type":"WGS","url":"http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/metagenome/mgm4440968.3?verbosity=metadata","md5_checksum":"d3cbf0557a9ef544dd2527cef997d098"}
