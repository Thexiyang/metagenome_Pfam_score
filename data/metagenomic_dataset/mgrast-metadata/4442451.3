The recent cultivation of the strain HBSQ001 and thesequencing of its genome allows comparison with the metagenome of this taxonomically simplified environment. Similar studies carried out in other extreme environments have revealed very little diversity in gene content among the cell lineages present.In this work we isolated biomass from a saltern crystallizer with the aim of retrieving mostly \"H. walsbyi\"- related material, and compared the recovered gene diversity with that of the sequenced strain's genome, isolated specifically from this same pond two years earlier [17]. The results of this study, which involved end-sequencing of ca. 2000 fosmid clones suggest that \"H. walsbyi\" shares a large accessory gene pool that could easily exceed the size of the sequenced strain's genome.","PI_organization_url":"http://egg.umh.es/frvalera/","email":" - "}},"sample":{"name":"mgs22033","data":{"geodetic_system":"wgs_84","longitude":".6","samp_mat_process":"filtering","continent":"europe","feature":"extreme habitat ; hypersaline","country":"Spain","material":"extreme habitat ; hypersaline","temperature":"30","isol_growth_condt":"16820057","salinity":"35","env_package":"water","collection_timezone":"UTC","collection_date":"2002-11-01","latitude":"38.2","samp_collect_device":"The sample was prefiltered through a filter paper to remove the biomass of small eucaryotic organisms (e.g. mosquitoes and copepods) and other particles in suspension.

Thawed filters were cut with a sterile razor blade in small pieces and vortexed in 2 ml of sterile water in 15 ml conical base polypropylene centrifuge tubes. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and 0.1 vol of 10% sodium dodecil sulphate and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) were added. The tubes were incubated at 55°C for 2 h and in a boiling water bath for 2 min. The lysates were extracted twice with phenol-clhoroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and once with chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1).
