At the time of sampling, hybrid striped bass were being raised in the main ponds. The Tilapia Channel (FW1) received the effluent from 96 production ponds. These sampling sites integrate the microbial and viral communities from either the nursery or the production ponds, thus avoiding pond-to-pond variation. Water samples were collected in November 2005, April 2006, and August 2006. Viral and microbial fractions were isolated from each water sample by passage through a 0.2-&#956;m tangential flow filter (TFF, Millipore, Westborough, MA, USA). The filtrate and the retentate were collected in separate tanks. The microbial fraction was collected from the 0.2-&#956;m TFF retentate by centrifugation at ~2000 Ã— g for 10&#8201;min. Microbial DNA was extracted using the Ultra Clean Soil DNA Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories, CA, USA).","samp_size":"80 L","env_package":"water","longitude":"-116.097751","biome":"freshwater","location":"Tilapia Channel (FW1) at Kent SeaTech, Salton Sea, CA","altitude":"-69.1896","continent":"na","isol_growth_condt":"20147985","material":"freshwater","collection_date":"2006-08-01","collection_timezone":"UTC","geodetic_system":"wgs_84","feature":"freshwater","elevation":"-69.1896"},"id":"mgs17527"},"env_package":{"type":"water","name":"mge51669","data":{"misc_param":"freshwater","env_package":"water"},"id":"mge51669"},"project":{"name":"Freshwater Fish from Aquaculture Facility Metagenomes - Viral an","public":"Freshwater Fish from Aquaculture Facility Metagenomes - Viral an","data":{"ncbi_id":"28407","PI_organization_country":"USA","firstname":" - ","PI_organization":"Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University","organization_url":" - ","PI_lastname":"Rodriguez-Brito","organization_country":" - ","project_name":"Freshwater Fish from Aquaculture Facility Metagenomes - Viral an","PI_organization_address":"San Diego, CA","organization_address":" - ","email":" - ","organization":" - ","PI_organization_url":"http://www.csrc.sdsu.edu/csrc/","lastname":" - ","project_funding":"US National Science Foundation, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, ARCS, NSF, ATP/Kent Sea Tech and EMBO","project_description":"In this study, we used metagenomics to monitor the viral and microbial communities in a stable, human-controlled aquatic environments over time.The study environment included a freshwater aquaculture system. Populations within the community were monitored at both the coarse-grained level of species and the fine-grained level of strains. On the basis of our results, we propose a model for these stable aquatic environments that is consistent with a Kill-the-Winner cycling of predator and prey populations and in which sensitive microbial strains are killed off by viral predators and are replaced by phage-resistant strains of the same species.","PI_firstname":"Beltran","PI_email":"beltran.rodriguezbrito@gmail.com"},"id":"mgp26"}},"id":"mgm4440422.3","pipeline_parameters":{"m5nr_sims_version":"7","filter_ln":"yes","file_type":"fna","bowtie":"yes","m5nr_annotation_version":"1","max_ambig":"5","filter_ambig":"yes","priority":"never","prefix_length":"50","dereplicate":"yes","m5rna_sims_version":"7","rna_pid":"97","assembled":"no","fgs_type":"454","aa_pid":"90","filter_ln_mult":"2.0","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens","m5rna_annotation_version":"1"},"pipeline_version":"3.0","library":["mgl51668","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl51668"],"version":1,"md5_checksum":"5d79181984dea834b293df413e1bf366","project":["mgp26","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/project/mgp26"],"mixs_compliant":1,"sample":["mgs17527","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs17527"],"job_id":"322","url":"http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/metagenome/mgm4440422.3?verbosity=metadata"}
