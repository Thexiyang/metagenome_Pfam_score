These sampling sites integrate the microbial and viral communities from either the nursery or the production ponds, thus avoiding pond-to-pond variation. Water samples were collected in November 2005, April 2006, and August 2006. Viral and microbial fractions were isolated from each water sample by passage through a 0.2-&#956;m tangential flow filter (TFF, Millipore, Westborough, MA, USA). The filtrate and the retentate were collected in separate tanks. The microbial fraction was collected from the 0.2-&#956;m TFF retentate by centrifugation at ~2000 Ã— g for 10&#8201;min.

On the basis of our results, we propose a model for these stable aquatic environments that is consistent with a Kill-the-Winner cycling of predator and prey populations and in which sensitive microbial strains are killed off by viral predators and are replaced by phage-resistant strains of the same species.","PI_email":"beltran.rodriguezbrito@gmail.com"}}},"pipeline_parameters":{"file_type":"fna","aa_pid":"90","priority":"never","m5nr_annotation_version":"1","fgs_type":"454","filter_ln":"yes","filter_ln_mult":"2.0","bowtie":"yes","m5rna_annotation_version":"1","dereplicate":"yes","filter_ambig":"yes","m5nr_sims_version":"7","assembled":"no","rna_pid":"97","prefix_length":"50","m5rna_sims_version":"7","max_ambig":"5","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens"},"job_id":"271","library":["mgl51672","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl51672"],"mixs_compliant":1,"created":"2007-12-23 18:56:40"}
