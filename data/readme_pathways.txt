As show in pathways.ods file,  the first eight pathways are involved in oxidize or reduce inorganic sulfur compounds to obtain
energy. Except for the oxidation of carbon disulfide (pathway 8) this pathways are commonly described as the “sulfur cycle”,
which means that most of key molecular marker genes belong to these pathways. Besides the  oxidation and reduction of inorganic
sulfur compounds, the  mobilization of organic sulfur compounds has a great impact on the biogeochemistry of planet,  specially
the  of degradation of dimethylsulfonioproprionate [13, 30–33]  which globally affects the biogeochemistry of the atmosphere and
ocean.  However there are also other organic sulfur compounds that are used and mobilized by different organisms like aliphatic
sulfonates, sulfur aminoacids, and organosulfonates to be used as a source of   carbon and sulfur to be assimilated into
biosynthetic pathways, or used in dessasimilative way to use as a source of carbon and energy substrate support growth, like  
methanesulfonate and taurine by methylotrophic bacteria and Pseudomona aeruginosa TU-5 respectively (metacyc).   Despite that
this organic compounds are not considerered as part of the biogeochemical sulfur cycle, the recycling of this compunds are
reflect of the ecological and physiological needs of the microbial structure community.  For this reason we also included the 
biosynthesis of sulfolipid as a part of the biogeochemical sulfur cycle,   because  it has been show that this can n be  a key
metabolic pathway in phosphorous  oligotrophic  and  rich-sulfur environments  as evidenced by the genome Bacillus coahuilensis,
an organism capable of synthesizing sulpholipids instead of phospholipids  in the membrane, as  reflecting of the  selective
pressures of their environment  [34].   In addition   to the  oxidation, reduction and degradation of organic compounds, we also
included  the methanogenesis  from methylated thiols such dimethyl sulfide DMS, metylthio-propanoate and methanethiol,  which are
generated in nature by  differente biogeoqchemical process, such as reduction of dimethyl sulfoxide, the anaerobic degradation
of methoxylated aromatics, anoxygenic photosynthesis demethylation of dimethylsulfoniopropanoate (metacyc).
