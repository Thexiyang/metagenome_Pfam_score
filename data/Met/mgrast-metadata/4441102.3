This tube-dwelling polychaete forms dense colonies exclusively on the walls of high-temperature black smoker chimneys, which are characterized by extreme physicochemical gradients and dynamic in thermal emission rates and intensive mineral precipitation.\r\n\r\nWe performed an environmental genomic analysis of the A. pompejana episymbiont community in an effort to define the basic metabolic strategy of the association and elucidate why Epsilonproteobacteria are so successful in this environment. We hypothesized that under extreme constraints imposed by the local geochemical environment, the Epsilonproteobacteria episymbiotic consortium employs a core metabolic strategy shared by most members of the community and that geochemical and thermal fluctuations impose significant selection pressures on the community. Identification of the metabolic and cellular features of this microbial community have provided details regarding the relationships between the symbionts and their host as well as the nature of epibiont adaptation in a dynamic physiochemical environment","PI_organization":"aDivision of Earth and Ecosystem Sciences, Desert Research Institute"},"id":"mgp4","name":"Alvinella Pompejana Epibiont Metagenome","public":"Alvinella Pompejana Epibiont Metagenome"}},"library":["mgl52468","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl52468"],"version":1,"job_id":"962","status":"public","mixs_compliant":0,"name":"Alvinella Pompejana Epibiont","sample":["mgs22665","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs22665"],"project":["mgp4","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/project/mgp4"],"sequence_type":"WGS"}
