DMSP is released from marine phytoplankton into surface sea water, where it supports up to 10% of bacterial carbon demand4. Vanillate and other lignin monomers are released during the microbial processing of vascular plant detritus, and they contribute significantly to the DOC pool in marsh-influenced coastal waters5. A coastal bacterial assemblage (0.23.0&#8201;&#956;m size fraction) was amended with 100&#8201;nM DMSP or vanillate in the presence of the thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)6, 7, and newly synthesized DNA was separated by immunocapture of BrdU-labelled DNA after 12&#8201;h. The captured DNA represented metagenomes of functional subsets of the bacterial community able to metabolize DMSP or vanillate. Bacterial assemblages without an added model DOC compound served as controls. Here we use experimental metagenomics to show that coastal communities are populated by taxa capable of metabolizing a wide variety of organic carbon compounds.","PI_email":"mmoran@uga.edu","PI_organization":"Department of Marine Sciences, University of Georgia","PI_firstname":"Mary Anne","PI_organization_address":"Athens, GA","project_funding":"National Science Foundation and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation","PI_lastname":"Moran","lastname":" - ","email":" - ","organization_address":" - ","organization_url":" - ","ncbi_id":"19145","firstname":" - ","organization_country":" - ","PI_organization_country":"USA","organization":" - ","PI_organization_url":"www.marsci.uga.edu"},"name":"Sapelo Island Bacterioplankton Vanillate/DSMP Study","public":"Sapelo Island Bacterioplankton Vanillate/DSMP Study"},"sample":{"id":"mgs11660","data":{"continent":"north_america","env_package":"water","location":"Sapelo Island, GA","country":"United States of America","material":"marine habitat","feature":"marine habitat","samp_collect_device":"Surface water was collected in acid-washed Nalgene carboys and immediately filtered through 3.0-&#956;m pore-size polycarbonate filters (Poretics Products) to exclude eukaryotes and large particles.","geodetic_system":"wgs_84","collection_date":"2005-11-01","longitude":"-81.2699","collection_timezone":"UTC","latitude":"31.3929","biome":"marine habitat","samp_mat_process":"filtering","isol_growth_condt":"18223640","samp_size":"20-litres"},"name":"mgs11660"},"env_package":{"data":{"misc_param":"10&#8201;&#956;M = concentration BrdU","env_package":"water","chem_administration":"100&#8201;nM DMSP","samp_store_temp":"4"},"name":"mge42177","id":"mge42177","type":"water"},"library":{"type":"WGS","id":"mgl42176","data":{"host_cells":"pCR 2.1 vector","reverse_barcodes":"1492R","pcr_clean_up_kits":"QIAquick kit; Qiagen","extension_duration_final":"000700","cycle_extension_temp":"72","sequences_sequences_filtered":"Removed redundant contigs","cloning_kit":"TA cloning kit; Invitrogen","extension_temp_final":"72","run_machine_type":"ABI Prism 3100 genetic analyser (Applied Biosystems)","metagenome_id":"4440360.3","cycle_annealing_temp":"62-52","library_institute":"University of Georgia","denaturation_temp_initial":"95","cycle_denaturation_duration":"000040","investigation_type":"mimarks-survey","seq_meth":"454","forward_primer_final_conc":"0.4","metagenome_name":"DMSP2SeawaterMic200511","gelatin_final_conc":"1","forward_barcodes":"27F","file_checksum":"1b3cb632ef9535cd587a56b37f5ea346","reverse_primer_final_conc":"0.4&#8201;","cycle_annealing_method":"touchdown","seq_center":"454 Life Sciences, Inc, Branford, CT","cycle_annealing_duration":"000040","cycle_denaturation_temp":"95","sequences_sequences_assembled":"Assembled contigs","pubmed_id":"18223640","denaturation_duration_initial":"000400","cycle_extension_duration":"000040","pcr_notes":"A touchdown PCR programme was used with the annealing temperature decreasing by 1&#8201;°C per cycle, followed by 15 cycles at 52&#8201;°C"},"name":"mgl42176"}},"library":["mgl42176","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl42176"],"name":"DMSP2SeawaterMic200511","job_id":"249","version":1,"url":"http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/metagenome/mgm4440360.3?verbosity=metadata","mixs_compliant":0,"pipeline_parameters":{"assembled":"no","m5rna_sims_version":"7","prefix_length":"50","m5nr_sims_version":"7","fgs_type":"454","rna_pid":"97","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens","aa_pid":"90","dereplicate":"yes","file_type":"fna","filter_ambig":"yes","m5nr_annotation_version":"1","filter_ln":"yes","filter_ln_mult":"2.0","max_ambig":"5","priority":"never","bowtie":"yes","m5rna_annotation_version":"1"}}
