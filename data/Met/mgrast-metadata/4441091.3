In the present study, we took a gene-centric approach to environmental sequencing in our analysis of several disparate microbial communities.\r\n\r\nThe samples we characterized were derived from agricultural soil and from three isolated deep-sea \"whale fall\" carcasses. In contrast to the nutrient-poor environments previously subjected to large-scale metagenomic sequencing (6, 7), each of these environments was nutrient-rich, albeit with very different nutrient sources (plant material for soil and lipid-rich bone for deep-sea whale fall samples). We first analyzed the microbial diversity in these samples through polymerase chain reaction (PCR)amplified small rRNA libraries generated for each sample by using primers specific for Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota. In the soil sample, a wide diversity of bacteria, few archaeal species, and some fungi and unicellular eukaryotes were found (fig. S2). We sequenced a total of 1700 clones from two independent libraries of PCR-amplified bacterial 16S rRNA sequences prepared from the soil DNA, and we identified at least 847 distinct ribotypes from more than a dozen phyla (fig. S2B).","organization_country":" - ","ncbi_id":"13699","project_name":"Waseca County Farm Soil Metagenome","PI_lastname":"Rubin","organization_address":" - ","PI_organization":"Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory","project_funding":"NIH, NSF","email":" - ","PI_organization_url":"www.lbl.gov","PI_email":"emrubin@lbl.gov","PI_organization_address":"Berkeley, CA "},"public":"Waseca County Farm Soil Metagenome"},"library":{"data":{"forward_barcodes":"27F, 21F","forward_primers":"5","metagenome_id":"4441091.3","reverse_barcodes":"1392R, 958R","sequences_sequences_predicted_genes":"Some Metagenome data has predicted genes","gold_id":"Gm00003","sequences_sequences_filtered":"Removed redundant contigs","reverse_primers":"5","pubmed_id":"15845853","metagenome_name":"Waseca Farm Soil","file_checksum":"1f6ebc64d0e2d6e4777e8dcf1dcf71e5","investigation_type":"mimarks-survey","sequences_sequences_assembled":"Assembled contigs","seq_meth":"sanger"},"name":"mgl53134","type":"WGS","id":"mgl53134"},"env_package":{"type":"soil","id":"mge53135","name":"mge53135","data":{"cur_land_use":"livestock (sheep, cattle, and pigs)","annual_season_precpt":"3.44 in","misc_param":"Potassium was present at 926.15 mg/kg dry weight","env_package":"soil","ph":"6-7 ; pH","annual_season_temp":"15","agrochem_addition":"in the drainage path of a silage storage bunker that had been used for sweet corn and pea silage waste operations from 1990 to 1997","extreme_salinity":"sodium at 75.38 mg/kg","store_cond":"The sample was collected and sealed in polyethylene bags and stored at 4°C for processing prior to archiving at -80°C."}}},"sample":["mgs25998","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs25998"],"project":["mgp8","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/project/mgp8"],"name":"Waseca Farm Soil","created":"2008-06-30 19:12:46"}
