Salinity was measured with a hand refractometer. The time between samplings ranged from 1 day to ~1.33 years (Table 1). Viral and microbial fractions were isolated from each water sample by passage through a 0.2-&#956;m tangential flow filter (TFF, Millipore, Westborough, MA, USA). The filtrate and the retentate were collected in separate tanks. The virus-containing filtrate was concentrated to a final volume of ~500&#8201;ml using a 100-kDa TFF filter. Polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) was added to a final concentration of 10% (w/v) and the mixture was incubated for 12-18&#8201;h at 4&#8201;ÃÂÃÂ°C. The VLPs were pelleted by centrifuging for 2&#8201;h at 22&#8201;000&#8201;rpm in an SW41Ti swinging bucket rotor (RCF avg=53&#8201;000 ÃÂÃÂ g). The VLP pellet was resuspended in filtered (100&#8201;kDa) saltern water to a final volume of ~50&#8201;ml. The virus concentrate was loaded onto a cesium chloride density gradient, centrifuged, and the 1.5&#8201;g&#8201;ml&#8722;1 fraction was collected.","continent":"north america","collection_time":"00:00:00","sample_name":"MedSalternSDbayVir20051110","env_package":"water","country":"United States of America","longitude":"-117.1072","latitude":"32.6","location":"Chula Vista, CA","feature":"saline evaporation pond","biome":"marine biome"},"id":"mgs69221"},"env_package":{"id":"mge69222","name":"MedSalternSDbayVir20051110: water","data":{"salinity":"12-14%","biomass":"6.42E8 VLPs/ml","env_package":"water","sample_name":"MedSalternSDbayVir20051110"},"type":"water"},"project":{"public":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","data":{"PI_organization_url":"www.csrc.sdsu.edu/","email":" - ","PI_organization":"Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University","firstname":" - ","organization_address":" - ","PI_organization_address":"San Diego, CA","lastname":" - ","project_funding":"NSF, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, ARCS Fellowship, NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship #DBI-0511948, ATP/Kent Sea Tech and EMBO ASTF366-2007 short-term fellowship.","project_description":"Water samples from the solar saltern of South Bay Salt Works (Chula Vista, CA, USA) were collected from three ponds with different salinities: low (68%), medium (1214%), and high (2730%). \r\nIn this study, we used metagenomics to monitor the viral and microbial communities in this and 3 other distinctive, stable, human-controlled aquatic environments over time. The study environments included a freshwater aquaculture system and three solar saltern environments of differing salinity. Populations within the communities were monitored at both the coarse-grained level of species and the fine-grained level of strains. On the basis of our results, we propose a model for these stable aquatic environments that is consistent with a Kill-the-Winner cycling of predator and prey populations and in which sensitive microbial strains are killed off by viral predators and are replaced by phage-resistant strains of the same species.","organization_country":" - ","PI_email":"beltran.rodriguezbrito@gmail.com","project_name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","organization_url":" - ","ncbi_id":"28353, 28725","PI_firstname":"Beltran","PI_lastname":"Rodriguez-Brito","organization":" - ","PI_organization_country":"USA"},"name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","id":"mgp11"},"library":{"type":"WGS","data":{"lib_size_mean":"100.4","seq_meth":"454","file_name":"MedSalternSDbayVir20051110.fna","pubmed_id":"18337718, 20147985","misc_param":"sequences_sequences_filtered: Removed redundant contigs","metagenome_id":"4440431.3","metagenome_name":"MedSalternSDbayVir20051110","file_checksum":"d8112ee169c2a64e486cf269ba3c21ba","gold_id":"Gm00134","investigation_type":"metagenome","sample_name":"MedSalternSDbayVir20051110","seq_center":"454 Life Sciences, Inc, Branford, CT"},"name":"MedSalternSDbayVir20051110","id":"mgl69223"}},"md5_checksum":"d8112ee169c2a64e486cf269ba3c21ba","mixs_compliant":1}
