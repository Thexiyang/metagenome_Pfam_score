In the present study, we took a gene-centric approach to environmental sequencing in our analysis of several disparate microbial communities.\r\n\r\nThe samples we characterized were derived from agricultural soil and from three isolated deep-sea \"whale fall\" carcasses (10). In contrast to the nutrient-poor environments previously subjected to large-scale metagenomic sequencing (6, 7), each of these environments was nutrient-rich, albeit with very different nutrient sources (plant material for soil and lipid-rich bone for deep-sea whale fall samples). We first analyzed the microbial diversity in these samples through polymerase chain reaction (PCR)Â–amplified small rRNA libraries generated for each sample by using primers specific for Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukaryota. In the soil sample, a wide diversity of bacteria, few archaeal species, and some fungi and unicellular eukaryotes were found (fig. S2). We sequenced a total of 1700 clones from two independent libraries of PCR-amplified bacterial 16S rRNA sequences prepared from the soil DNA, and we identified at least 847 distinct ribotypes from more than a dozen phyla (fig. S2B).","ncbi_id":"13700","PI_organization":" Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Genomics Division","project_funding":"NIH, NSF","project_name":"\"Whale Fall\" Bone Metagenome"},"name":"\"Whale Fall\" Bone Metagenome","public":"\"Whale Fall\" Bone Metagenome","id":"mgp9"}},"job_id":"1512","created":"2008-10-21 21:25:38","version":1,"mixs_compliant":0,"project":["mgp9","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/project/mgp9"],"name":"Whale Fall Bone","pipeline_parameters":{"filter_ln_mult":"2.0","file_type":"fna","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens","aa_pid":"90","assembled":"no","filter_ambig":"yes","filter_ln":"yes","m5rna_sims_version":"7","max_ambig":"5","rna_pid":"97","priority":"never","prefix_length":"50","fgs_type":"454","m5nr_annotation_version":"1","m5rna_annotation_version":"1","bowtie":"yes","dereplicate":"yes","m5nr_sims_version":"7"},"md5_checksum":"ab77e35214b98bd390c1abba35c5fa8a"}
