However, study of viral metagenomes has been hampered by its nearly complete reliance on BLAST algorithms for identification of DNA sequences. We sought to develop algorithms for examination of viral metagenomes to identify the origin of sequences independent of BLAST algorithms. We chose viral metagenomes obtained from two hot springs, Bear Paw and Octopus, in Yellowstone National Park, as they represent simple microbial populations where comparatively large contigs were obtained. Thermal spring metagenomes have high proportions of sequences without significant Genbank homology, which has hampered identification of viruses and their linkage with hosts. To analyze each metagenome, we developed a method to classify DNA fragments using genome signature-based phylogenetic classification (GSPC), where metagenomic fragments are compared to a database of oligonucleotide signatures for all previously sequenced Bacteria, Archaea, and viruses.","organization_country":" - ","firstname":" - ","organization_url":" - ","PI_organization_address":"Stanford, CA","project_funding":"NSF, Burroughs Wellcome Fund, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the UNCF-Merck Science Initiative to DP","lastname":" - ","ncbi_id":"20821","PI_firstname":"Thomas","PI_email":"tschoenfeld@lucigen.com","PI_organization_url":"http://med.stanford.edu/id/","project_name":"Viral Metagenome from Terrestrial Hot Springs","email":" - ","organization_address":" - "},"name":"Viral Metagenome from Terrestrial Hot Springs"},"env_package":{"id":"mge52283","type":"water","name":"mge52283","data":{"ammonium":"<0.04 mg/L","env_package":"water","nitrite":"0.0630 mg/L","alkalinity":"343 mg/L","potassium":"15.4 mg/L","magnesium":"0.011 mg/L","bromide":"0.8 mg/L","calcium":"0.765 mg/L","nitrate":"<0.1 mg/L","sulfate":"17.6","suspend_part_matter":"9.0 × 105 cells/ml, 3.07 × 105 viruses/ml","density":"0.99911 mg/L","silicate":"288","salinity":"297 mg/L of sodium","diss_org_carb":"1.4 mg/L","chloride":"246 mg/L"}},"sample":{"id":"mgs21722","data":{"samp_size":"630 L","elevation":"~2438","samp_mat_process":"filtering","samp_collect_device":"Thermal water (400 to 600 liters) was filtered using a 100,000-molecular cutoff (MWCO) tangential-flow filter (GE Healthcare).

Immediate freezing of samples in liquid nitrogen was not possible, so viral abundances may be somewhat underestimated.","continent":"na","country":"United States of America","isol_growth_condt":"18441115","geodetic_system":"wgs_84","collection_date":"2003-10-04","longitude":"110.797944","latitude":"44.534167","temperature":"93","env_package":"water","altitude":"~2438","location":"Yellowstone Natl Park","ph":"8.14","collection_timezone":"UTC","biome":"hot spring","feature":"hot spring","material":"hot spring"},"name":"mgs21722"},"library":{"type":"WGS","name":"mgl52282","data":{"file_checksum":"99ea0d443b6b2cdfdaa753cba615cc3d","cloning_kit":"pSMART vector (Lucigen)","pcr_clean_up_methods":"Gel fractionation","sequences_sequences_filtered":"Viral-metagenome sequencing reads were compared to the nonredundant protein database (GenBank) using BLASTx (2, 3).
