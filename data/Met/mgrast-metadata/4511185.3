We will make this connection by applying novel molecular and nanotechnological tools to examine the distribution of extracellular enzyme genes and functions across taxonomic groups of  microbes. Using the trait distributions among taxa, we will model the response of C decomposition rates to changes in water and nitrogen (N) availability, as well as plant species composition.","organization_address":"3208 Croul Hall - University of California - Irvine - Irvine, CA 92697","organization":"University of California Irvine","organization_country":"USA","PI_firstname":"Steve D.","organization_url":"http://www.uci.edu/"},"name":"Loma_Ridge_grassland","public":"Loma_Ridge_grassland"}},"status":"public","sample":["mgs95476","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs95476"],"pipeline_parameters":{"m5nr_annotation_version":"1","file_type":"fastq","dereplicate":"yes","m5nr_sims_version":"7","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens_asm","assembled":"no","priority":"never","rna_pid":"97","aa_pid":"90","m5rna_annotation_version":"1","bowtie":"yes","prefix_length":"50","fgs_type":"454","m5rna_sims_version":"7","min_qual":"15","max_lqb":"5","dynamic_trim":"yes"},"library":["mgl95478","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl95478"],"created":"2013-01-07 18:51:47","name":"D11XXB_F1_2","job_id":"78818","md5_checksum":"567ca76ff989fa900d1a5142d15a478c","id":"mgm4511185.3","pipeline_version":"3.0","sequence_type":"WGS","project":["mgp1992","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/project/mgp1992"],"url":"http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/metagenome/mgm4511185.3?verbosity=metadata"}
