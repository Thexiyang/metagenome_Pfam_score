Gyres, which cover 70% of the ocean surface, are low in surface nutrients and productivity. At BATS, cool winter weather and large storms cause deep winter mixing of the water column, bringing nutrients to the surface that stimulate spring phytoplankton blooms, which are followed by summer lows in productivity. The natural seasonality of the BATS spring bloom is providing an opportunity for addressing questions about episodic productivity and biogeochemical processes that intercept and remineralize organic matter to carbon dioxide. The goal of this metagenomic study is to identify functional genes and biochemical pathways associated with eukarytotic phytoplankton and the microbial populations that remineralize organic carbon to carbon dioxide.","project_funding":"Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation","PI_email":"steve.giovannoni@oregonstate.edu","PI_firstname":"Stephen","PI_organization_country":"USA","email":" - ","PI_organization_address":"Corvallis, OR","PI_lastname":"Giovannoni","PI_organization":"Oregon State University","organization":" - ","PI_organization_url":"http://giovannonilab.science.oregonstate.edu/","organization_address":" - ","lastname":" - ","firstname":" - ","project_name":"Metagenomic Analysis of the North Atlantic Spring Bloom","organization_country":" - "},"name":"Metagenomic Analysis of the North Atlantic Spring Bloom","id":"mgp37","public":"Metagenomic Analysis of the North Atlantic Spring Bloom"}},"mixs_compliant":0,"version":1,"created":"2009-06-03 21:19:01","id":"mgm4443731.3","project":["mgp37","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/project/mgp37"],"sample":["mgs24860","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs24860"],"url":"http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/metagenome/mgm4443731.3?verbosity=metadata","md5_checksum":"6752f233642fdeb7b7152d834ad2ff21","sequence_type":"WGS"}
