The study environments included a freshwater aquaculture system and three solar saltern environments of differing salinity. Populations within the communities were monitored at both the coarse-grained level of species and the fine-grained level of strains. On the basis of our results, we propose a model for these stable aquatic environments that is consistent with a Kill-the-Winner cycling of predator and prey populations and in which sensitive microbial strains are killed off by viral predators and are replaced by phage-resistant strains of the same species.","lastname":" - ","project_name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","PI_firstname":"Beltran","organization_url":" - ","PI_organization":"Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University","firstname":" - ","organization_country":" - ","PI_organization_url":"www.csrc.sdsu.edu/","PI_email":"beltran.rodriguezbrito@gmail.com","PI_organization_country":"USA","email":" - "},"name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","public":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","id":"mgp11"},"library":{"data":{"metagenome_id":"4440419.3","file_checksum":"2bcba72d0bd3d814daa309768b0e8c77","investigation_type":"metagenome","gold_id":"Gm00134","sample_name":"HighSalternSDbayMic20051128","lib_size_mean":"103.7","misc_param":"sequences_sequences_filtered: Removed redundant contigs","file_name":"HighSalternSDbayMic20051128.fna","seq_center":"454 Life Sciences, Inc, Branford, CT","metagenome_name":"HighSalternSDbayMic20051128","pubmed_id":"18337718, 20147985","seq_meth":"454"},"id":"mgl69166","type":"WGS","name":"HighSalternSDbayMic20051128"},"env_package":{"id":"mge69165","type":"water","name":"HighSalternSDbayMic20051128: water","data":{"biomass":"6.69E7 cells/ml","salinity":"27-30%","env_package":"water","sample_name":"HighSalternSDbayMic20051128"}},"sample":{"id":"mgs69164","name":"HighSalternSDbayMic20051128","data":{"country":"United States of America","continent":"north america","samp_collect_device":"Water samples from the solar saltern of South Bay Salt Works (Chula Vista, CA, USA) were collected from three ponds with different salinities: low (6-8%), medium (12-14%), and high (27-30%).
