The sample was pre-filtered with 5 µm mesh to remove zooplankton and large phytoplankton. The microbial fraction in the sample was then concentrated using a Pro-Flux model M-12 tangential flow filtration device (Millipore, Bedford MA, U.S.A.) using a spiral-wound filter with a 30 kDa cutoff. The volume was reduced to 1160 ml. 1000 ml was treated with 1 µg ml&#8722;1 Mitomycin C to stimulate prophage induction and 160 ml was left untreated as a control. After a 24 hour incubation in the dark, the number of viral particles was enumerated in both the treatment and control samples using SYBR Gold staining. The treatment concentrate contained 3.5×109 virus-like particles (VLP's) ml&#8722;1, which was a statistically significant 3-fold increase in virus abundance in comparison to the non-amended control. The treatment sample was centrifuged and 0.2 µm filtered to separate most of the remaining bacterial cells and debris from the viruses. The viruses were then concentrated by polyethylene glycol precipitation and purified by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation [31]. The viral capsids were disrupted by formamide and the nucleic acids precipitated with ethanol and purified by CTAB extraction [31].","collection_timezone":"UTC","continent":"na","biome":"marine habitat","geodetic_system":"wgs_84","longitude":"-122.0757","env_package":"water","collection_date":"2005-12-13","country":"United States of America","material":"marine habitat","isol_growth_condt":"18810270","latitude":"37.6299","samp_size":"200 L"},"name":"mgs21744"}},"url":"http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/metagenome/mgm4440102.3?verbosity=metadata","name":"TBPhageInduction20051213","sequence_type":"WGS","library":["mgl52286","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl52286"],"md5_checksum":"1bb17c8f2d1cd25d022f11761c29059d","id":"mgm4440102.3"}
