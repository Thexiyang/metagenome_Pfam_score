On day 29, microcosms were either enriched with a solution of 10 mg NO3--N (+NO3-) or received distilled water as a control (&#150;N).  There were six microcosms in each treatment.  Metagenomes were created from soil samples collected on day 30 using 1/16th of a sequencing plate.","administrative-contact_PI_organization":"The Holden Arboretum","lastname":"Kyker","administrative-contact_PI_organization_url":"www.holdenarb.org","administrative-contact_PI_organization_address":"9500 Sperry Road ; 44094 ; Kirtland ; OH","PI_email":"","PI_lastname":"","PI_firstname":"","firstname":"Sarah","PI_organization_country":"","organization_country":"United States of America","administrative-contact_PI_firstname":"Sarah","email":"SarahRKyker@gmail.com"}},"env_package":{"id":"mge52169","data":{"current":"nd","diss_carb_dioxide":"nd","samp_store_dur":"12 May 2008 ; June 2008","organism_count":"nd","samp_store_loc":"-70 degree freezer","-natural-or-artificial-environment_temp":"16.0 ; Celsius","misc_param":"Denitrification Rate ; 0 ; Kilogram","diether_lipids":"nd","nitrite":"nd","ph":"6.0 ; pH","perturbation":"nd","samp_store_temp":"-70 ; Celsius","silicate":"nd","calcium":"nd","density":"nd","org_carb":"nd","salinity":"nd","diss_oxygen":"nd","bromide":"nd","env_package":"miscellaneous","nitrate":"nd","org_nitro":"nd","org_matter":"nd","chlorophyll":"nd","chloride":"nd","diss_hydrogen":"nd","chem_administration":"nd","pressure":"nd ; Atmosphere","sulfide":"nd","oxy_stat_samp":"nd","phosphate":"nd","potassium":"nd","alkalinity":"nd","ammonium":"nd","phosplipid_fatt_acid":"nd","nitro":"nd","biomass":"nd","sulfate":"nd"},"type":"miscellaneous","name":"mge52169"},"sample":{"name":"mgs21388","id":"mgs21388","data":{"latitude":"41.50","collection_time":"12:45:00","country":"United States of America","location":"Hunting Valley, OH","collection_date":"2007-11-28","samp_collect_device":"Soil samples were collected with sterile forceps from vernal pool microcosms.
