The study environments included a freshwater aquaculture system and three solar saltern environments of differing salinity. Populations within the communities were monitored at both the coarse-grained level of species and the fine-grained level of strains. On the basis of our results, we propose a model for these stable aquatic environments that is consistent with a Kill-the-Winner cycling of predator and prey populations and in which sensitive microbial strains are killed off by viral predators and are replaced by phage-resistant strains of the same species.","PI_organization_country":"USA","project_name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","lastname":" - ","PI_organization":"Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University","ncbi_id":"28353, 28725","organization_url":" - ","PI_organization_url":"www.csrc.sdsu.edu/","PI_email":"beltran.rodriguezbrito@gmail.com","PI_organization_address":"San Diego, CA","PI_lastname":"Rodriguez-Brito","organization_country":" - ","email":" - ","organization_address":" - "},"name":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study","id":"mgp11","public":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study"},"library":{"type":"WGS","id":"mgl69175","name":"HighSalternSDbayMicC200407","data":{"investigation_type":"metagenome","file_name":"HighSalternSDbayMicC200407.fna","metagenome_name":"HighSalternSDbayMicC200407","metagenome_id":"4440433.3","seq_center":"454 Life Sciences, Inc, Branford, CT","sample_name":"HighSalternSDbayMicC200407","pubmed_id":"18337718, 20147985","seq_meth":"454","file_checksum":"f01469471d141cba7d3df954e30bf8b0","lib_size_mean":"101.1","gold_id":"Gm00134","misc_param":"sequences_sequences_filtered: Removed redundant contigs"}},"env_package":{"id":"mge69174","type":"water","data":{"sample_name":"HighSalternSDbayMicC200407","salinity":"27-30%","env_package":"water"},"name":"HighSalternSDbayMicC200407: water"},"sample":{"name":"HighSalternSDbayMicC200407","data":{"samp_collect_device":"Water samples from the solar saltern of South Bay Salt Works (Chula Vista, CA, USA) were collected from three ponds with different salinities: low (6-8%), medium (12-14%), and high (27-30%).
