On the basis of a comparative metagenomic analysis of viral communities associated with marine (Highborne Cay, Bahamas) and freshwater (Pozas Azules II and Rio Mesquites, Mexico) microbialites, we show that some phage genotypes are geographically restricted.","email":" - ","organization_country":" - ","ncbi_id":"28355","PI_organization_url":"www.usf.edu","project_funding":"National Geographic Society, University of South Florida Internal Awards Program, Alfred P.
