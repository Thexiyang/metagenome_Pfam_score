To identify the functional bases for adaptation, we sequenced the genomes of two cyanobacterial (Synechococcus OS-A and OS-B') isolates representing ecologically distinct populations that dominate at different temperatures and are major primary producers in the mat.\r\n\r\nWe also generated metagenomic sequences from recombinant libraries from total DNA isolated from the top green layer (upper approx1 mm) of the microbial mats in Octopus Spring and from Mushroom Spring, a nearby spring with similar physicochemical characteristics.","PI_organization_url":"www-ciwdpb.stanford.edu","PI_lastname":"Bhaya","organization_address":" - ","ncbi_id":"20721","lastname":" - ","organization_url":" - ","PI_organization_address":"Stanford, CA","PI_firstname":"Devaki","email":" - ","PI_organization":"Stanford University","firstname":" - ","PI_organization_country":"USA","organization_country":" - ","organization":" - "},"id":"mgp6","public":"Yellowstone National Park Octopus/Mushroom Hot Springs Metagenom","name":"Yellowstone National Park Octopus/Mushroom Hot Springs Metagenom"},"library":{"name":"mgl51594","type":"WGS","id":"mgl51594","data":{"file_checksum":"9ba49c9cc35f83093a671934c19a8c14","sequences_sequences_combined_libraries":"Sequences are from combined libraries","sequences_sequences_assembled":"Assembled contigs","sequences_sequences_predicted_genes":"Some Metagenome data has predicted genes","gold_id":"Gm00125","lib_type":"Plasmid","seq_meth":"other","pubmed_id":"18059494","sequences_sequences_filtered":"Removed redundant contigs and Frameshifts and point mutations were detected and corrected where appropriate","metagenome_name":"MushroomSpringsMatCoreF","investigation_type":"metagenome","metagenome_id":"4443762.3"}},"sample":{"name":"mgs17160","id":"mgs17160","data":{"isol_growth_condt":"18059494","collection_timezone":"UTC","longitude":"-110.690","biome":"hot spring ; microbial mat","samp_mat_process":"filtering","collection_date":"2003-10-03","continent":"na","depth":".001","geodetic_system":"wgs_84","samp_collect_device":"Synechococcus JA-2-3Aa {genotype designation A-NACy05a} (hereafter Synechococcus OS-A) was isolated by filter cultivation from samples derived from a region of the mat in Octopus Spring exposed to temperatures ranging from 58°C to 65°C; Synechococcus JA-2-3B'a(2-13) {genotype designation B'NACy10o} (hereafter Synechococcus OS-B') was isolated from Octopus Spring mat samples collected at temperatures ranging from 51 to 61°C (Allewalt et al., 2006)","material":"hot spring ; microbial mat","temperature":"65","country":"United States of America","latitude":"44.376","location":"Yellowstone Natl Park Hot Springs, Moran, WY","feature":"hot spring ; microbial mat"}}},"status":"public","version":1,"created":"2009-06-03 21:46:52","url":"http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/metagenome/mgm4443762.3?verbosity=metadata","mixs_compliant":0,"job_id":"3699","name":"MushroomSpringsMatCoreF","pipeline_parameters":{"screen_indexes":"h_sapiens","m5nr_annotation_version":"1","rna_pid":"97","filter_ln":"yes","max_ambig":"5","file_type":"fna","m5rna_annotation_version":"1","bowtie":"yes","filter_ln_mult":"2.0","dereplicate":"yes","assembled":"no","fgs_type":"454","priority":"never","m5nr_sims_version":"7","prefix_length":"50","m5rna_sims_version":"7","aa_pid":"90","filter_ambig":"yes"},"pipeline_version":"3.0","sample":["mgs17160","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs17160"],"id":"mgm4443762.3","md5_checksum":"9ba49c9cc35f83093a671934c19a8c14","library":["mgl51594","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl51594"],"project":["mgp6","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/project/mgp6"],"sequence_type":"WGS"}
