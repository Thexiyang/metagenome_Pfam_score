At the time of sampling, hybrid striped bass were being raised in the main ponds.These sampling sites integrate the microbial and viral communities from either the nursery or the production ponds, thus avoiding pond-to-pond variation. Water samples were collected in November 2005, April 2006, and August 2006. Viral and microbial fractions were isolated from each water sample by passage through a 0.2-&#956;m tangential flow filter (TFF, Millipore, Westborough, MA, USA). The filtrate and the retentate were collected in separate tanks. The virus-containing filtrate was concentrated to a final volume of ~500&#8201;ml using a 100-kDa TFF filter. Polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) was added to a final concentration of 10% (w/v) and the mixture was incubated for 12-18&#8201;h at 4&#8201;°C. The VLPs were pelleted by centrifuging for 2&#8201;h at 22&#8201;000&#8201;rpm in an SW41Ti swinging bucket rotor (RCF avg=53&#8201;000 × g). The VLP pellet was resuspended in filtered (100&#8201;kDa) saltern water to a final volume of ~50&#8201;ml. The virus concentrate was loaded onto a cesium chloride density gradient, centrifuged, and the 1.5&#8201;g&#8201;ml&#8722;1 fraction was collected. At each step, recovery of viral particles was verified by epifluorescence microscopy. The viral DNA was isolated by formamide lysis and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide extraction (Sambrook et al., 1982).","feature":"freshwater"},"id":"mgs17494"},"project":{"name":"Freshwater Fish from Aquaculture Facility Metagenomes - Viral an","data":{"PI_lastname":"Rodriguez-Brito","PI_organization_url":"http://www.csrc.sdsu.edu/csrc/","organization_country":" - ","project_description":"In this study, we used metagenomics to monitor the viral and microbial communities in a stable, human-controlled aquatic environments over time.The study environment included a freshwater aquaculture system. Populations within the community were monitored at both the coarse-grained level of species and the fine-grained level of strains. On the basis of our results, we propose a model for these stable aquatic environments that is consistent with a Kill-the-Winner cycling of predator and prey populations and in which sensitive microbial strains are killed off by viral predators and are replaced by phage-resistant strains of the same species.","PI_firstname":"Beltran","project_funding":"US National Science Foundation, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, ARCS, NSF, ATP/Kent Sea Tech and EMBO","ncbi_id":"28407","PI_organization_address":"San Diego, CA","PI_email":"beltran.rodriguezbrito@gmail.com","email":" - ","project_name":"Freshwater Fish from Aquaculture Facility Metagenomes - Viral an","PI_organization_country":"USA","organization":" - ","organization_address":" - ","PI_organization":"Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University","lastname":" - ","firstname":" - ","organization_url":" - "},"public":"Freshwater Fish from Aquaculture Facility Metagenomes - Viral an","id":"mgp26"}},"project":["mgp26","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/project/mgp26"],"mixs_compliant":1,"name":"TpondKentSTVir200511","created":"2007-12-24 01:30:38","md5_checksum":"75cdb52d986c07030c63bed2a13faed8","status":"public"}
