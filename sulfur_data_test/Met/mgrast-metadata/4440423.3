Populations within the community were monitored at both the coarse-grained level of species and the fine-grained level of strains. On the basis of our results, we propose a model for these stable aquatic environments that is consistent with a Kill-the-Winner cycling of predator and prey populations and in which sensitive microbial strains are killed off by viral predators and are replaced by phage-resistant strains of the same species.","email":" - ","project_funding":"US National Science Foundation, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, ARCS, NSF, ATP/Kent Sea Tech and EMBO","lastname":" - ","organization_url":" - ","organization":" - ","PI_lastname":"Rodriguez-Brito","project_name":"Freshwater Fish from Aquaculture Facility Metagenomes - Viral an","PI_organization_address":"San Diego, CA","PI_organization_country":"USA","organization_address":" - ","organization_country":" - ","ncbi_id":"28407","PI_organization":"Computational Science Research Center, San Diego State University","PI_organization_url":"http://www.csrc.sdsu.edu/csrc/","PI_firstname":"Beltran","PI_email":"beltran.rodriguezbrito@gmail.com"}}},"sample":["mgs23088","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs23088"],"md5_checksum":"4d7474f5d2ef5fa15ac780b04b521f16","pipeline_parameters":{"prefix_length":"50","m5rna_annotation_version":"1","priority":"never","file_type":"fna","assembled":"no","m5nr_sims_version":"7","m5rna_sims_version":"7","max_ambig":"5","rna_pid":"97","bowtie":"yes","filter_ln_mult":"2.0","m5nr_annotation_version":"1","filter_ln":"yes","dereplicate":"yes","aa_pid":"90","filter_ambig":"yes","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens","fgs_type":"454"},"created":"2007-12-23 20:44:28","project":["mgp26","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/project/mgp26"],"job_id":"318","sequence_type":"WGS","pipeline_version":"3.0","status":"public","id":"mgm4440423.3"}
