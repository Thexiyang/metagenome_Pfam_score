We share this computational approach (written in perl and python) to evaluate and compare the importance of global biogeochemical cycles (or bigger metabolic pathways) in  multigenomic scale. We hope it can help other researchers. 

This algorithm can be used with sets of gene families from particular metabolic pathways to search specific ecological capabilities, belonging either to different habitats or biogeochemical cycles. 

The algoritm is divided in four stages:

### STAGE 1. Compilation of datasets and databases

##STAGE 2. Annotating protein domains

##STAGE 3. Estimating relative entropy of protein domains

##STAGE 4. Sulfur Score (SS) and interpretation
