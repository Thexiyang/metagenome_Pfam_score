The study environments included a freshwater aquaculture system and three solar saltern environments of differing salinity. Populations within the communities were monitored at both the coarse-grained level of species and the fine-grained level of strains. On the basis of our results, we propose a model for these stable aquatic environments that is consistent with a Kill-the-Winner cycling of predator and prey populations and in which sensitive microbial strains are killed off by viral predators and are replaced by phage-resistant strains of the same species."},"id":"mgp11","public":"Chula Vista, CA Solar Saltern Study"}},"pipeline_version":"3.0","created":"2007-12-05 19:00:30","url":"http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/metagenome/mgm4440324.3?verbosity=metadata","status":"public","project":["mgp11","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/project/mgp11"],"md5_checksum":"2bc64e6b2ccc3afdef328fb45ff4835e","name":"LowSalternSDbayMic20051110","sequence_type":"WGS","pipeline_parameters":{"dereplicate":"yes","m5nr_annotation_version":"1","rna_pid":"97","assembled":"no","prefix_length":"50","priority":"never","filter_ambig":"yes","m5rna_annotation_version":"1","aa_pid":"90","m5rna_sims_version":"7","bowtie":"yes","filter_ln":"yes","file_type":"fna","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens","filter_ln_mult":"2.0","m5nr_sims_version":"7","max_ambig":"5","fgs_type":"454"},"job_id":"223","mixs_compliant":1,"version":1,"sample":["mgs69194","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs69194"],"id":"mgm4440324.3"}
