(A fraction of ) mobile gene pool represented by plasmid-like covalently closed double-stranded circular supercoiled DNA molecules was extracted directly from the microbial community, sequenced and assembled. Two WWTPs were sampled : Morges (GPS: 46.5166N, 6.51014E) (municipal waste waters plus hospital effluents; sampled twice-- in 2007 and in 2009) and Visp (GPS: 7.85940W, 46.30044N; mainly (bio)chemical synthesis industry effluents, sampled once in 2009). Short description of the data sets in the project: 4464065.3 (WWTP Morges-2007 Sanger reads);4474073.3 (WWTP Morges-2009 454-reads); 4464108.3 (WWTP Visp-2009, Sanger reads from 8-10 kb insert library); 4464109.3 (WWTP Visp-2009, 454 reads); 4474000.3 (WWTP Morges 2007/2009 contigs assembled by MIRA 3 assembler, only >5x covered contigs longer than 1 kb). For comparison two artificial sets were produced by in silico shearing 1848 NCBI plasmids to pieces of 753 bp (imitating Sanger reads, 4482706.3) and 270 bp (imitating 454 reads, 4482707.3) plus remaining 'tails'.","organization_country":"Switzerland","organization_address":"Biophore Building, UNIL-Sorge, 1015 Lausanne","firstname":"Vladimir","PI_email":"vladimir.sentchilo@unil.ch","PI_organization_url":"http://www.unil.ch/dmf/page14867.html","email":"vladimir.sentchilo@unil.ch","lastname":"Sentchilo","project_name":"WWTP activated sludge plasmid (and viral) metagenomes from Switzerland","administrative-contact_PI_organization_address":"BÃ¢timent Biophore, Quartier UNIL-Sorge ; 1015 ; Lausanne ;","project_funding":"University of Lausanne, Switzerland.United States Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (US DOE JGI) as part of the Community Sequencing Program 2007 (project CSP 776886)","administrative-contact_PI_lastname":"Sentchilo","PI_organization":"Department of Fundamental Microbiology, University of Lausanne"}},"env_package":{"id":"mge99677","type":"wastewater|sludge","name":"Activated sludge plasmids M07 (MORGES2007-SANGER): wastewater|sludge","data":{"tot_phosphate":"5.65 mg P/L","chem_administration":"antibiotics from hospital, heavy metals","chem_oxygen_dem":"378 mg O2/l","ph":"7","wastewater_type":"human waste, rainfall, storm drains,hospital effluent","nitrate":"1.88 mg N/l","phosphate":"6.96 mg P/l","indust_eff_percent":"0","env_package":"wastewater|sludge","biochem_oxygen_dem":"122 mg O2/l","sample_name":"Activated sludge plasmids M07 (MORGES2007-SANGER)","sewage_type":"municipal"}},"library":{"id":"mgl99678","data":{"seq_center":"DOE JGI","investigation_type":"metagenome","gold_id":"Gm00049","file_name":"Morges2007_reads.fasta","seq_url":"http://www.jgi.doe.gov/","seq_model":"ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer","seq_meth":"sanger","sample_name":"Activated sludge plasmids M07 (MORGES2007-SANGER)","file_checksum":"e6d141b85751b89426023f05b7270f2a","metagenome_name":"Activated sludge plasmids M07 (MORGES2007-SANGER)","metagenome_id":"4464065.3"},"name":"Activated sludge plasmids M07 (MORGES2007-SANGER)","type":"WGS"}},"url":"http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/metagenome/mgm4464065.3?verbosity=metadata","md5_checksum":"e6d141b85751b89426023f05b7270f2a","pipeline_parameters":{"bowtie":"no","m5nr_annotation_version":"1","prefix_length":"50","m5rna_annotation_version":"1","priority":"never","filter_ambig":"yes","dereplicate":"no","max_ambig":"5","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens_asm","fgs_type":"454","aa_pid":"90","m5rna_sims_version":"7","filter_ln_mult":"-5.49","m5nr_sims_version":"7","assembled":"no","file_type":"fna","rna_pid":"97","filter_ln":"no"}}
