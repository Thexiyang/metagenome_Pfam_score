We will make this connection by applying novel molecular and nanotechnological tools to examine the distribution of extracellular enzyme genes and functions across taxonomic groups of  microbes. Using the trait distributions among taxa, we will model the response of C decomposition rates to changes in water and nitrogen (N) availability, as well as plant species composition.","organization":"University of California Irvine","PI_email":"allisons@uci.edu","organization_country":"USA"},"public":"Loma_Ridge_grassland","id":"mgp1992","name":"Loma_Ridge_grassland"},"sample":{"id":"mgs95374","data":{"env_package":"soil","sample_name":"AU10_XXA","longitude":"-117.703419","sample_id":"AU10_XXA","elevation":"370","material":"soil","altitude":"370","continent":"north america","location":"Loma_Ridge","collection_timezone":"UTC-8","feature":"meadow","country":"United States of America","samp_mat_process":"Grinding","collection_date":"2010-08-20","latitude":"33.739556","depth":"0.1","collection_time":"12:00:00","biome":"Montane grasslands and shrubland biome","samp_collect_device":"Direct DNA extraction using a protocol derived from Hanson et al. 2008"},"name":"AU10_XXA"}},"version":1,"mixs_compliant":1,"project":["mgp1992","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/project/mgp1992"],"created":"2013-01-04 01:16:42","md5_checksum":"c0ed514c31f9dc1fcc2554b6d13a94d8","url":"http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/metagenome/mgm4511060.3?verbosity=metadata","sequence_type":"WGS","pipeline_version":"3.0","pipeline_parameters":{"priority":"never","file_type":"fastq","dereplicate":"yes","prefix_length":"50","m5rna_sims_version":"7","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens_asm","aa_pid":"90","assembled":"no","fgs_type":"454","rna_pid":"97","max_lqb":"5","dynamic_trim":"yes","m5rna_annotation_version":"1","m5nr_annotation_version":"1","min_qual":"15","m5nr_sims_version":"7","bowtie":"yes"},"name":"AU10_XXA","library":["mgl95376","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl95376"],"sample":["mgs95374","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs95374"]}
