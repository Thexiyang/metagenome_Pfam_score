In the present study, we established the composition of the A. brasiliensis microbiome and the metabolic pathways associated with this community. We used 454 shotgun pyrosequencing to generate approximately 640,000 high-quality sponge-derived sequences (,150 Mb). Clustering analysis including sponge,\r\nseawater and twenty-three other metagenomes derived from marine animal microbiomes shows that A. brasiliensis contains a specific microbiome. Fourteen bacterial phyla (including Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Cloroflexi) were consistently found in the A. brasiliensis metagenomes. The A. brasiliensis microbiome is enriched for Betaproteobacteria (e.g., Burkholderia) and Gammaproteobacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas and Alteromonas)\r\ncompared with the surrounding planktonic microbial communities. Functional analysis based on Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (RAST) indicated that the A. brasiliensis microbiome is enriched for sequences associated with\r\nmembrane transport and one-carbon metabolism. In addition, there was an overrepresentation of sequences associated with aerobic and anaerobic metabolism as well as the synthesis and degradation of secondary metabolites. This study\r\nrepresents the first analysis of sponge-associated microbial communities via shotgun pyrosequencing, a strategy commonly\r\napplied in similar analyses in other marine invertebrate hosts, such as corals and algae. We demonstrate that A. brasiliensis has a unique microbiome that is distinct from that of the surrounding planktonic microbes and from other marine organisms, indicating a species-specific microbiome.","project_funding":"Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo (FAPESP), Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (FAPERJ) and Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq).","PI_organization_address":"Rio de Janeiro","firstname":" - "}},"library":{"id":"mgl78981","type":"WGS","name":"AmaroAb6","data":{"seq_meth":"454","metagenome_id":"4461452.3","metagenome_name":"Sponge_Ab5","investigation_type":"metagenome","file_name":"AmaroAb6.fasta","file_checksum":"a612041e5cdbfb2aba084d0c9d771aa9","sample_name":"AmaroAb6"}},"sample":{"data":{"material":"organic material","country":"Brazil","temperature":"24","collection_timezone":"UTC-2","sample_name":"AmaroAb6","longitude":"-41.874604","env_package":"host-associated","location":"JoÃ£o fernandinho beach, bÃºzios peninsula, Rio de Janeiro state","biome":"marine sponge reef biome","sample_id":"AmaroAb6","collection_date":"2011-01-01","collection_time":"11:00:00","latitude":"-22.738705","depth":"4","continent":"south america","feature":"organism-associated habitat"},"id":"mgs78979","name":"AmaroAb6"}},"id":"mgm4461452.3","library":["mgl78981","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl78981"],"created":"2011-05-19 16:13:27","project":["mgp2222","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/project/mgp2222"],"md5_checksum":"a612041e5cdbfb2aba084d0c9d771aa9","job_id":"21049","version":1,"status":"public","pipeline_parameters":{"rna_pid":"97","filter_ambig":"yes","fgs_type":"454","m5nr_sims_version":"7","priority":"never","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens_asm","max_ambig":"5","file_type":"fna","bowtie":"no","aa_pid":"90","prefix_length":"50","dereplicate":"yes","filter_ln":"yes","m5rna_sims_version":"7","m5rna_annotation_version":"1","assembled":"no","filter_ln_mult":"2.00","m5nr_annotation_version":"1"},"pipeline_version":"3.0","name":"Sponge_Ab5"}
