Despite this, it is not well understood at the metabolic level. Here we present a metagenomic analysis of two lab-scale EBPR sludges dominated by the uncultured bacterium, Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis. The analysis sheds light on several controversies in EBPR metabolic models and provides hypotheses explaining the dominance of A. phosphatis in this habitat, its lifestyle outside EBPR and probable cultivation requirements. Comparison of the same species from different EBPR sludges highlights recent evolutionary dynamics in the A. phosphatis genome that could be linked to mechanisms for environmental adaptation.","PI_organization_url":"http://web.mit.edu/","PI_email":"delong@mit.edu","organization_url":" - ","PI_lastname":"DeLong","PI_organization_country":"USA","organization":" - ","organization_country":" - ","PI_firstname":"Edward","lastname":" - ","project_funding":"\t Doe Joint Genome Institute ","project_name":"Phosphorus Removing (EBPR) Sludge Community","organization_address":" - ","PI_organization":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","email":" - ","firstname":" - ","ncbi_id":"29435"}},"sample":{"id":"mgs17437","name":"mgs17437","data":{"samp_collect_device":"The OZ SBR was inoculated with activated sudge from Thornside Sewage Treatment Plant in Queensland, Australia. It had a working volume of 8 liters, was operated in four cycles of 6 h. per day. Each cycle consisted of 150 min anaerobic period, 180 min anerobic period, 30 min. settling and, in 5 min of effluent withdrawing (900 ml).  The HRT was 24 h. and SRT was kept at 8 days by sludge wastage during the aerobic phase. The pH was kept at 7.0 and the SBR operating temperature was 23-24oC during all stages. To achieve anaerobic and aerobic conditions, nitrogen gas and air was bubbled through the liquid respectively. The SBR was fed with propionate and a synthetic feed. Sludge biomass was collected directly from the US and OZ SBRs at the end of the anaerobic period when polyphosphate inclusions were at their lowest, since polyphosphate interferes with DNA extraction.DNA was extracted from frozen sludge aliquots (2 ml) using the FastDNA SPIN kit (Qbiogene), following the manufacturer's instructions, and quantified by spectrophotometric analysis at 260 nm.","longitude":"153.01667","samp_mat_process":"DNA extraction","isol_growth_condt":"16820057","samp_size":"8 liters","elevation":"24","continent":"australia","altitude":"24","feature":"sludge","geodetic_system":"wgs_84","country":"Australia","latitude":"-27.467","collection_timezone":"UTC","biome":"sludge","collection_date":"2004-08-18","location":"Thornside Sewage Treatment Plant","material":"sludge","temperature":"23-24"}}},"job_id":"954","name":"Australian Phosphorus Removing (EBPR) Sludge","library":["mgl51648","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl51648"],"created":"2008-06-30 19:18:22","sample":["mgs17437","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs17437"],"version":1,"url":"http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/metagenome/mgm4441092.3?verbosity=metadata","pipeline_parameters":{"bowtie":"yes","filter_ln":"yes","file_type":"fna","m5nr_sims_version":"7","filter_ln_mult":"2.0","max_ambig":"5","aa_pid":"90","filter_ambig":"yes","dereplicate":"yes","priority":"never","m5rna_sims_version":"7","fgs_type":"454","m5nr_annotation_version":"1","prefix_length":"50","rna_pid":"97","m5rna_annotation_version":"1","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens","assembled":"no"},"mixs_compliant":0,"sequence_type":"WGS","id":"mgm4441092.3","status":"public"}
