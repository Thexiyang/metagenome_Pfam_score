Using the 454-FLX sequencer, we generated 202,648 sequences with an average length of 173.8 bases. Functional profiles were assigned by the SEED Annotation Engine. In the metagenome of the 0.2-&#956;m-passable microorganisms, genes related to membrane function, including potassium homeostasis classified as membrane transport, and multidrug-resistance efflux pumps classified as virulence, were dominant. There was a higher proportion of genes pertinent to the subsystem of membrane transport in our metagenomic library than in other oceanic and hydrothermal vent metagenomes. Genes associated with a RND-type efflux transporter for exogenous substances were specifically identified in the present study. After a comparative analysis with the genome of the known ultramicrobacterium Sphingopyxis alaskensis RB2256, we discovered 1,542 cases of significant hits (E&#8201;<&#8201;1&#8201;×&#8201;10&#8722;2) in our metagenome, and 1,172 of those were related to the DNA repair protein RadA. In this way, the microbial functional profile of 0.2-&#956;m-passable fraction in the present study differs from oceanic metagenomes in the 0.2-&#956;m-trapped fractions and hydrothermal vent metagenomes reported in previous research.
