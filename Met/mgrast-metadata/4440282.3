This analysis concerns the sample collection at two sites on Level 27 (714 m below the surface; Figure 1). Water and sediments were sampled from the two locations shown in Figure 1 giving the \"Black\" (reduced) sample and \"Red\" (oxidized) sample. Microbes were concentrated from these samples by filtration with 0.22 &#956;m Sterivex units. Microbial counts were enumerated by staining the samples with SYBR-Gold (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and visualization with an epifluorescent microscope [21].

Generating and interpreting the biological sequence data was a costly and time-consuming process in defining an environment.
