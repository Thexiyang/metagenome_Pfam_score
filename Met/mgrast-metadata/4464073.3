(A fraction of ) mobile gene pool represented by plasmid-like covalently closed double-stranded circular supercoiled DNA molecules was extracted directly from the microbial community, sequenced and assembled. Two WWTPs were sampled : Morges (GPS: 46.5166N, 6.51014E) (municipal waste waters plus hospital effluents; sampled twice-- in 2007 and in 2009) and Visp (GPS: 7.85940W, 46.30044N; mainly (bio)chemical synthesis industry effluents, sampled once in 2009). Short description of the data sets in the project: 4464065.3 (WWTP Morges-2007 Sanger reads);4474073.3 (WWTP Morges-2009 454-reads); 4464108.3 (WWTP Visp-2009, Sanger reads from 8-10 kb insert library); 4464109.3 (WWTP Visp-2009, 454 reads); 4474000.3 (WWTP Morges 2007/2009 contigs assembled by MIRA 3 assembler, only >5x covered contigs longer than 1 kb). For comparison two artificial sets were produced by in silico shearing 1848 NCBI plasmids to pieces of 753 bp (imitating Sanger reads, 4482706.3) and 270 bp (imitating 454 reads, 4482707.3) plus remaining 'tails'.","organization_country":"Switzerland","PI_organization_country":"Switzerland","organization":"Department of Fundamental Microbiology, University of Lausanne","PI_organization_address":"Biophore Building, UNIL-Sorge, 1015 Lausanne","PI_email":"vladimir.sentchilo@unil.ch","PI_lastname":"Sentchilo","administrative-contact_PI_organization_url":"www.unil.ch/dmf","project_funding":"University of Lausanne, Switzerland.United States Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (US DOE JGI) as part of the Community Sequencing Program 2007 (project CSP 776886)","firstname":"Vladimir","PI_firstname":"Vladimir","administrative-contact_PI_organization_address":"BÃ¢timent Biophore, Quartier UNIL-Sorge ; 1015 ; Lausanne ;","email":"vladimir.sentchilo@unil.ch","organization_url":"http://www.unil.ch/dmf/page14867.html","administrative-contact_PI_firstname":"Vladimir","project_name":"WWTP activated sludge plasmid (and viral) metagenomes from Switzerland","PI_organization_url":"http://www.unil.ch/dmf/page14867.html","administrative-contact_PI_organization_country":"Switzerland","organization_address":"Biophore Building, UNIL-Sorge, 1015 Lausanne","lastname":"Sentchilo","administrative-contact_PI_email":"vladimir.sentchilo@unil.ch","PI_organization":"Department of Fundamental Microbiology, University of Lausanne","administrative-contact_PI_lastname":"Sentchilo"}},"env_package":{"id":"mge99680","name":"Activated sludge plasmids M09 (MORGES2009-454): wastewater|sludge","data":{"tot_phosphate":"5.65 mg P/L","chem_administration":"antibiotics from hospital, heavy metals","sewage_type":"municipal","sample_name":"Activated sludge plasmids M09 (MORGES2009-454)","env_package":"wastewater|sludge","indust_eff_percent":"0","nitrate":"1.88 mg N/l","chem_oxygen_dem":"467 mg O2/l","biochem_oxygen_dem":"144 mg O2/l","wastewater_type":"human waste, rainfall, storm drains,hospital effluent","ph":"7","phosphate":"6.96 mg P/l"},"type":"wastewater|sludge"}},"version":1,"library":["mgl99681","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/library/mgl99681"],"status":"public","created":"2011-05-19 16:17:51","name":"Activated sludge plasmids M09 (MORGES2009-454)","sample":["mgs99679","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs99679"],"pipeline_version":"3.0","md5_checksum":"47f598ddd38f28ca9547816acca092d1","job_id":"23670","mixs_compliant":1,"sequence_type":"WGS","project":["mgp731","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/project/mgp731"],"pipeline_parameters":{"priority":"never","m5rna_sims_version":"7","filter_ambig":"no","file_type":"fna","bowtie":"no","rna_pid":"97","assembled":"no","prefix_length":"50","fgs_type":"454","aa_pid":"90","m5nr_sims_version":"7","filter_ln":"no","screen_indexes":"h_sapiens_asm","m5nr_annotation_version":"1","dereplicate":"yes","max_ambig":"25","filter_ln_mult":"-1.63","m5rna_annotation_version":"1"},"url":"http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/metagenome/mgm4464073.3?verbosity=metadata"}
