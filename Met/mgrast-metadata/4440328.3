This method yielded sediment cores with an average length of 35 cm. Sediment from one core was extruded at 1-cm intervals, and the sediment from each interval was then split. Following the method of Wardlaw and Valentine, pore water was extracted from one-half of the sediment by centrifugation (12,000 x g, 15 min) and filtered through a 0.2-µm filter. The remaining sediment was stored at -80°C for subsequent molecular analyses. Sediment from a second core was extruded at 1-cm intervals, placed in acid-washed (20% HCl), precombusted (450°C, 4 h) glass vials, and stored at -20°C prior to analysis of bulk sediment chemical properties."},"id":"mgs17271","name":"mgs17271"},"project":{"name":"Salton Sea ","public":"Salton Sea ","id":"mgp54","data":{"firstname":" - ","organization_url":" - ","PI_organization":"University of California ","organization_address":" - ","project_description":"Sulfidic, anoxic sediments of the moderately hypersaline Salton Sea contain gradients in salinity and carbon that potentially structure the sedimentary microbial community.
