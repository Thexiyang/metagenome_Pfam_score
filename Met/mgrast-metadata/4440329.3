This method yielded sediment cores with an average length of 35 cm. Sediment from one core was extruded at 1-cm intervals, and the sediment from each interval was then split. Following the method of Wardlaw and Valentine, pore water was extracted from one-half of the sediment by centrifugation (12,000 x g, 15 min) and filtered through a 0.2-µm filter. The remaining sediment was stored at -80°C for subsequent molecular analyses. Sediment from a second core was extruded at 1-cm intervals, placed in acid-washed (20% HCl), precombusted (450°C, 4 h) glass vials, and stored at -20°C prior to analysis of bulk sediment chemical properties."},"name":"mgs17260","id":"mgs17260"}},"name":"SaltonSeaMic20060823","mixs_compliant":0,"sample":["mgs17260","http://api.metagenomics.anl.gov/1/sample/mgs17260"],"md5_checksum":"05def7efbfe116659cc0d96e8ead5db7","pipeline_version":"3.0"}
